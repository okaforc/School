## Q4
**D:** 4 columns, as there is one for each action

## Q5
5.1 is what happens when the random number is OUTSIDE of epsilon (less than epsilon -1), epsilon is the level of exploration. So, this is exploiting the information already known
5.2 happens when it is exploring!!! Random choice
### Q5.1
**B:** choose the most logical choice based off of what we've learned already, however there might be several best options, so pick randomly between those.

### Q5.2
**E:** choose from the actions completely randomly

## Q6
