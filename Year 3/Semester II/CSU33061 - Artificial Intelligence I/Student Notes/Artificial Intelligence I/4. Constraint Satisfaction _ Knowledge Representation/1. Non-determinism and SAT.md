## Returning to computation as search!
![[Pasted image 20230313093026.png]]


If more than one Node satisfies arc(Node,Next), 
- This is non-determinism
- We choose the Next 
	- Closest to the goal (heurisitic h, or using Q like in Q learning)
	- Or by keeping track of costs (min cost, A*)
- Available choices depend on arc
	- similar to Turing machine (moving right), or graph

Computation eliminates non-determinism:
**determinisation**

Bound iterations of search (number of calls to arc):

## Terminating search
Times out after too many ticks
```prolog
bSearch(Node,_) :- goal(Node). 
bSearch(Node,Bound) :- 
	arc(Node,Next), 
	tick(Bound,Less), 
	bSearch(Next,Less).
```

Design tick to be terminating, ie: ***no*** infinite sequence x1, x2, ... such that $tick(x_i,x_{i+1})$ for every integer i >0

Set Bound based on Start node:
```prolog
search(Start) :- bound(Start,Bound), 
				bSearch(Start,Bound).
```

## Feasability and non-determinism: P vs NP
![[Pasted image 20230313094329.png]]

Clearly, $P \subseteq NP$ 

We have no idea if $P = NP$!
If $P \neq NP$ non-determinism wrecks feasibility
If $P = NP$, non determinism makes no difference to feasibility.

### More Details - What does solvable in polynomial time mean?

Characterised by infinite complexity classes, better to characterise as below!


## Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
**SAT:** Given a boolean expression $\varphi$ with variables x1,...,xn, can we make $\varphi$ true by assigning true/false values to x1,...,xn

Not determinism (guessing the assignment) means that SAT is in NP.
But! is SAT in P? $2^n$ assignments to try

### CSAT
![[Pasted image 20230320090847.png]]
Taking boolean expression (with and in it)

#### k-SAT
every clause has exactly k literals

#### 3-SAT
3-SAT is as hard as SAT, although 2-SAT is in P

#### Horn-SAT
every clause has at most one positive literal â€” linear

### Prolog and SAT
Prolog KB (definite clauses):
```prolog
x1 :- x2,x4.
x2 :- x3.
x4.

%goes to%
[[x1,x2,x4],[x2,x3],[x4]]
```
