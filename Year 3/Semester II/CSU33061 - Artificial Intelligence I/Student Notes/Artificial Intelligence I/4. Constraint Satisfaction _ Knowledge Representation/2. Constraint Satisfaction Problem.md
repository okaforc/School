## Constraint Satisfaction Problem [Var,Dom,Con]
1. a list Var = [X1, . . . , Xn] of variables Xi 
2. a list Dom = [D1, . . . , Dn] of finite sets Di of size si 
3. a finite set Con of constraints that may or may not be satisfied by (a node) instantiating Xi with a value in Di (search space size $\Sigma^n_{i=1}s_i$)

### Eg SAT

### Problem:
satisfy all constraints in Con, instantiating variables if necessary/convenient
(When do you instantiate variables???:)

## Order-independent unification (Martelli-Montanari)
**Input:** set $\mathcal{E}$ of pairs [t,t']
**Output:** substitution /[[X1,t1], . . . , [Xk,tk]/] unifying pairs in $\mathcal{E}$

### Steps
Simplify $\mathcal{E}$ non-deterministically until no longer possible

**NOTE** prolog omits check $X \in Var(t)$ in 5,6 for speedup

### Prolog - instantiate before negation (as failure)

Need to actually instantiate it somehow before negation, otherwise will always fail

#### 1. Brute force solution - Generate and test
instantiate all variables before testing constraints
![[Pasted image 20230320092955.png]]
node generates values to instantiate variables
constraint tests all of them

Then, ![[Pasted image 20230320093008.png]]
Can be checked in polynomial time! But, that is a dumb way of doing it. Instead, you should instantiate based on the constraints, not just all values!


#### 2. Inferring Changes - slightly less dumb
An example using HornSAT (by minimal changes to 00 · · · 0 (all variables start off 0/false))
![[Pasted image 20230320093412.png]]

For each stage i, collect the variables set at stage i to 1/true in $A_i$.

![[Pasted image 20230320093513.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230320093525.png]]

We are checking is false $\notin A_n$ 

No minimal set for non-Horn x ∨ y (or xor)

#### 3. Instantiate one variable at a time - another step less dumb
![[Pasted image 20230320094213.png]]

**Payoff:** search tree of depth n and branching factor max$_i$  s$_i$ with start node instantiating no variable, and an arc instantiating least uninstantiated variable

![[Pasted image 20230320094352.png]]
Start off with no instantiation, and at each step instantiate one of the uinstantiated variables

#### 4. Interleave generation with testing + backtracking
Whenever arc(N0,N1),
- N1 instantiates one more variables than N0 AND
- N1 satisfies every constraint on instantiated variables

Optimizing backtracking search
1. **MRV:** instantiate variable with **M**inimum **R**emaining **V**alues (minimizes branching/cases)
2. **LCV:** assign **L**east **C**onstraining **V**alue (greatest chance of success)
