## Managing Choices with Frontier Search
### Frontier Search in general
```prolog
% frontierSearch(Frontier)
frontierSearch([Node|_]) :- goal(Node). % First element of the frontier goal node? success!

frontierSearch([Node|Rest]) :- % otherwise
	findall(Next, arc(Node, Next), Children), % Find all nodes which the head element has an arc to
	add2frontier(Children, Rest, NewFrontier), % Add all the new nodes to the frontier
	frontierSearch(NewFrontier). % Search the new frontier
```
frontierSearch takes in the current frontier as a list of nodes.

#### add2frontier DFS 
```prolog
add2frontier(Children, Rest, Frontier) :- append(Children, Rest, NewFrontier).
```

Add newly discovered children to start of frontier (top of stack).

#### add2frontier BFS
```prolog
add2frontier(Children, Rest, Frontier) :- append(Rest, Children, NewFrontier).
```

Adds newly discovered elements to end of frontier (back of queue).

#### add2frontier - general requirements
Given `add2frontier(Children, Rest, NewFrontier)`, requires
1. `NewFrontier` merges `Children` and `Rest`
2. Where list L merges lists L1 and L2 if
	1. Every member of L is a member of L1 or L2
	2. Every member of L1 or L2 is a member of L

## Exercise
Suppose a positive integer `Seed` links nodes 1, 2, . . . in two ways 
```prolog
arc(N,M,Seed) :- M is N*Seed.
```
```prolog
arc(N,M,Seed) :- M is N*Seed +1.
```
e.g. Seed=3 gives arcs (1,3), (1,4), (3,9), (3, 10) . . .


Goal nodes are multiples of a positive integer Target
```prolog 
goal(N,Target) :- 0 is N mod Target.
``` 
 e.g. Target=13 gives goals 13, 26, 39 . . .

Modify frontier search to define predicates 
```prolog
breadth1st(+Start, ?Found, +Seed, +Target)
``` 
```prolog
depth1st(+Start, ?Found, +Seed, +Target)
``` 
that search breadth-first and depth-first respectively for a `Target`-goal node Found linked to Start by `Seed`-arcs.

### My Solution

```prolog
arc(N,M,Seed):- M is N*Seed.
arc(N,M,Seed):- M is N*Seed +1.

goal(N,Target):- 0 is N mod Target.

search(Node) :- frontierSearch([Node]).

% breadth1st(+Start, ?Found, +Seed, +Target)
breadth1st(Start,Found,Seed,Target):- frontierSearch([Start], Found, Seed, Target, bfs).

% depth1st(+Start, ?Found, +Seed, +Target)
depth1st(Start,Found,Seed,Target):- frontierSearch([Start], Found, Seed, Target, dfs).

% frontierSearch(+Frontier, ?Found, +Seed, +Target, +DepthOrBreadth)

% Check head for goal node
frontierSearch([Node|_], Node, _, Target, _) :- goal(Node, Target).

% Extend frontier
frontierSearch([Node|Rest], Found, Seed, Target, DepthOrBreadth) :- 
	findall(Next, arc(Node,Next,Seed), Children),
	add2frontier(Children,Rest,NewFrontier,DepthOrBreadth),
	frontierSearch(NewFrontier, Found, Seed, Target, DepthOrBreadth).

% add2frontier for BFS - adding Children to end of queue
add2frontier(Children,[],Children, bfs).
add2frontier(Children,[H|T],[H|More], bfs) :- 
	add2frontier(Children,T,More, bfs).

% add2 frontier for DFS - adding Children to start of queue
add2frontier([],Rest,Rest, dfs). 
add2frontier([H|T],Rest,[H|TRest], dfs) :- 
	add2frontier(T,Rest,TRest, dfs).

% query
breadth1st(1, Found, 4, 15).

```

### His solution

```prolog
arc(N,M,Seed):- M is N*Seed.
arc(N,M,Seed):- M is N*Seed +1.

goal(N,Target):- 0 is N mod Target.

bf(Start,Found,Seed,Target):- fs([Start], Found, Seed, Target).

fs([N|_],N,_,Target) :- 
	%print(N), nl, 
	goal(N,Target).


% Breadth first
fs([N|R],F,S,T):- findall(X,arc(N,X,S), Ch), append(R,Ch,New), fs(New,F,S,T).


% Depth First
fs([N|R],F,S,T):- findall(X,arc(N,X,S), Ch), append(Ch, R,New), fs(New,F,S,T).

% query
bf(1, Found, 3, 13).
```

## Refining frontier search
Given `add2frontier(Children, Rest, NewFrontier)`, and `NewFrontier = [Head|Tail]`
1. Require `NewFrontier` merges `Children` and `Rest`
2. Ensure `Head` is "no worse than" `Tail`. Options for this
	1. Head *costs no more* than any element in Tail (cost function written to assign costs)
		- This is *minimum cost search*
		- Minimum cost search = BFS if every arc costs 1 (effectively unweighted)
	2. Head is deemed *no further from a goal node* than any element in Tail 
		- This is *best first search*
		- The deeming of no further away is called a *heuristic*
		- Best first search = DFS if the heuristic is dependant on the depth
	3. Some mix of 1 and 2
		- This is A-star

Note that none of the descriptions given above actually tell you how cost/heuristic is implemented.

### Costs
You can define a cost by whatever you want - eg: time, space, money.
This is the Australia map given at [[2. Frontier Search - Blind Searches (BFS,DFS)#Graph modelling]]
![[Pasted image 20230418152803.png]]

#### How to find costs
Given above, how do we find the cost to get from `WA` to `NSW` (note that the option given here is not the only route!)?
	cost(`WA`, `NT`, `Q`, `NSW`) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

In general, the cost is the individual sum of costs along the path (i.e., it is *NOT* a running sum).
![[Pasted image 20230418153149.png]]
### Heuristics
Estimates!
h(`Node`) is the heuristic function.
h(`Node`) = estimate the minimum cost of a path from `Node` to a goal node

Often, ends up being an estimate assuming a lot of arcs, simplifying the problem (eg an arc between every node, so there is an easy quick route)

#### Examples of heuristics
##### FSM
FSM accept, where node = `[Q, String]`, and every arc costs 1.
	h(`[Q,String]`) = length(String)

##### Prolog search
Prolog search where node = `List of Propositions to prove`, and every arc costs 1
	h(`List`) = length(`List`)

##### Euclidean Plane
Where node = `point on Euclidean plane`, and cost = `distance between nodes`, and goal is a point `G`
	h(`Node`) = straight line distance to `G`



## Best-First Search
Best first search depends on **heuristics being a reasonable estimate of a cost to a goal node**.

### How? 
Form `NewFrontier` = `[Head|Tail]` such that
	h(`Head`) $\leq$ h(`Node`) for every `Node` in `Tail`

Head always has smaller value than every element of the tail (requires some amount of searching). 

### Bad case
![[Pasted image 20230418154142.png]]

Sometimes best-first search is bad 
1. Assume here that the heuristic is distance between points
2. The frontier will get stuck in a loop trying to get closer
3. Never actually reaches the goal

## Minimum-cost Search
**Note:** Not BFS - Becomes breadth first search if all arcs have weight 1.
Ignores heuristic, defined only relevant to start, not the goal!

### How?
Form `NewFrontier` = `[Head|Tail]` such that
	`cost(Start...Head)` $\leq$  `cost(Start...Node)` for every `Node` in `Tail`

The distance from the start point to the head is always smaller than the distance from the start point to any element in the tail. 

Note that the cost is defined based on the path to a node,
- NOT the node on its own
- NOT the overall history

#### Representing node
1. As a path to a node

OR

2. As a pair `(node, cost(Start...node))`

### Example
Given this graph, trying to get from `WA` to `NSW`
![[Pasted image 20230418154842.png]]

1. This is the formula for cost:![[Pasted image 20230418153149.png]]
2. `cost(WA, NT, Q, NSW) = 5`
3. `cost(WA, SA, NSW) = 8`

## A-star Search
Building solution incrementally, using cost and heuristic.

### How?
1. Define solution ![[Pasted image 20230418155717.png]]
2. Then, define a function f which combines cost and heuristic
	`f(start ... n) = cost(start ... n) + h(n)`
3. Then, form `NewFrontier` = `[Head|Tail]` such that 
	- Head has minimal f
	- `f(start...n)` $\leq$  `f(start...n)` for every `n` in `Tail`

### Relationship to min-cost
If h(n) always = 0, then it's just min-cost.

### Relationship to best-first
If cost(start...n) always = 0, then it's just best first (ignoring the past)

### Admissability
A-star is admissible (under `cost,h`) if it returns a solution of minimum cost whenever it exists.

3 sufficient (not necessary) conditions for admissability:
1. **Under-estimate:** 
	- For every solution $n...goal$:
	- $0 \leq$ `h(n)` $\leq$ `cost(n...goal)`
	- (Heuristic is always less than cost)

2. **Termination:** 
	- For some $\epsilon > 0$, every arc costs $\geq \epsilon$
	- All arcs are positive, so if a path is sufficiently long, it will eventually exceed another cost and terminate that path

3. **Finite branching:** 
	- $\{n'|arc(n,n')\}$ is finite for each node n
	- There are no nodes with infinite arcs

#### Proof: A-star returns a solution with min cost c
Assuming the conditions above, let p be a solution.

We are trying to show that A-star returns a solution with minimum cost c

Let 
1. $F_0=[Start]$, 
2. $F_{n+1}$ be $A^*$'s next frontier after $F_n$  ([] if none)
3. $c_n$ be the cost of the head of $F_n$ ($\infty$ if $F_n=[]$).

Then,
1. For all $n \geq 0$ such that $c_{n} <c, F_n$ has a prefix of p
2. $c = c_n$ for some $n$ such that the head of $F_n$ is a solution
