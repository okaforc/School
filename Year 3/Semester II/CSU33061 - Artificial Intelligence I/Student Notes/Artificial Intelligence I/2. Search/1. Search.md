Given solution:
```prolog
accept(_,Final,Q,[]):- member(Q,Final).
accept(Trans,Final,Q,[H|T]):-
	member([Q,H,Qn],Trans),
	accept(Trans,Final,Qn,T).

member(X,[X|_]).
member(X,[_|L]):- member(X,L).
	
% query
accept([[q0,0,q1],[q0,1,q1],[q1,0,q0],[q1,1,q0]], [q1], q0, [1,0,0]).
```
Note, black box, never know anything other than current state and current input.

## Search in Prolog
Given `goal, arc` (arc is relation between nodes)
```prolog
search(Node):- goal(Node).
search(Node):- arc(Node,Next), search(Next).
```
```prolog
accept(Trans,Final,Q0,String).
```
Assume Node is [Q,UnseenString]. Then, writing it properly

### Goal 
```prolog
% goal(Node, Next, SetFinalStates)
goal(Q,[],Final):- member(Q,Final).
```
The goal has been reached if Next is empty, and Node is a member of the Final states

### Arc
```prolog
% arc(CurrNode, Next, SetTransitions)
arc([Q,[H|T]], [Qn,T], Trans):- member([Q,H,Qn],Trans).
```
- CurrNode is `[Current state, [First element of input | Rest of Input]]`
- Next is the state we are checking if there is a connection to (or finding a connection to), followed by the rest of the input
- There is an arc if the `[Current State, First element of input, Next State]` is an element of the Transitions set

### Search
```prolog
% search(CurrentState, CurrentInput, FinalStates, Transitions)
search(Q,S,F,T):- goal(Q,S,F).
search(Q,S,F,T) :- arc([Q,S],[Qn,Sn],T),
	search(Qn,Sn,F,T).
```
- search succeeds if `goal(CurrentState, CurrentInput, FinalStates)` is true, so if CurrentInput is empty, and CurrentStates is in FinalStates
- Otherwise, If there is an arc from CurrentState to a NewState, given CurrentInput and Transitions, we call search on that

### Accept
```prolog
accept(T,F,Q,S) :- search(Q,S,F,T).
```

Computation is search!!!!

## Prolog as Search

Another way of describing this search, as a proof tree!
```prolog
prove(Node):- goal(Node).
prove(Node):- arc(Node,Next), prove(Next).
```

### Implementing this - Knowledge Base
Knowledge as lists
![[Pasted image 20230417163947.png]]

#### Arc
```prolog
% arc(Node1,Node2,KnowledgeBase)
arc([H|T],Next,KB) :- member([H|B],KB), append(B,T,Next).
```
(Clause in knowledge base with that head.)
- Node 1 is the current node, seperated into its head and tail
- Node 2 is the next node
- member finds if node 1's head starts any of KB's elements, and returns the rest of the element that head starts as B
- Then, the the rest of KB's element (excluding the head) is concatenated with Node 1's tail, and is returned as Next

##### Note
```arc([p,q],[q],[[p]]) and arc([i],[p,q],[[i,p,q]])```

#### Goal
```prolog
goal([]).
```
Goal has been achieved if the input is empty

#### Prove
```prolog
% prove(Input,KnowledgeBase)
prove(Node, _) :- goal(Node).
prove(Node,KB) :- arc(Node,Next,KB), prove(Next,KB).
```
- Base case, if the Node is a goal (i.e., Node is empty), then it has been proven
- Otherwise, find a node there is an arc to, and try to prove that


#### Non termination

Always grows as p:-i.

##### Determinization - solving non-termination
A FSM [Trans, Final, Q0] such that for all [Q,X,Qn] and [Q,X,Qn'] in Trans, Qn = Qn' is a **deterministic finite automaton** (DFA).
(From every state there is only one possible state to move to, given a specific input)

###### FSM to DFA
**Fact:** Every FSM has a DFA accepting the same language.

**Proof** :
by subset (powerset) construction. 
Collect all nodes each can access

Example given below

(ignore these, they aren't correct. just leaving them here in case i suddenly find it making sense and don't want to retype it all out :3) 
1. `{q0}`
	1. Starting at `q0`, when given the input `a`, the next state will be `q1`. Therefore, the state path is `{q0, q1}`
	2. Starting at `q0`, when given the input `b`, the next state will be invalid, and the DFA will restart. Therefore. the state path is `{q0}`
2. `{q0, q1}`
	1. Starting at `q0` with the next state at `q1`, given the input `a`, the next state will be invalid, and the DFA will restart from that point. Therefore, the state path is `{q0, q1}`
	2. Starting at `q0` with the next state at `q1`, given the input `b`, the *updated* next state will be `q2`. Therefore, the state path is `{q0, q2}`
3. `{q0, q2}`
	1. Starting at `q0` with the next state at `q2`, given the input `a`, the *updated* next state will be `q3`. Therefore, the state path is 
	2. Starting at `q0` with the next state at `q1`, given the input `b`, the *updated* next state will be `q2`. Therefore, the state path is `{q0, q2}`
