### A language no FSM can accept
$\{\epsilon,ab,aabb,aaabbb,...\}$
context free grammar $S \rightarrow \varepsilon | aSb$ 

Add the blank symbol is # and actions are write (a/# or b/#), move left (#< or a,b<).

For $\varepsilon$, q0 and #.

**Anything else:**
1. See an a, turn it into a hash symbol
2. Move right past the hash
3. Move right past a or b until you see a hash, then go back 1
4. Must see "b", replace it with a hash, 
5. Go back past the hash
6. Go back to the start and repeat!

#### Formally
Tm = fm + MLeft/Write/Halt
**Turing machine** (Tm) M is a 5-tuple [MRight, MLeft, Write, Halt, Q0]
where 
- MRight is a list of triples [Q,X,Qn] such that at state Q and seeing symbol X, M may move right, and change state to Qn
- Q0 is Mâ€™s initial state 
- MLeft is a list of triples [Q,X,Qn] such that at Q and seeing X, M may move left, and change state to Qn 
- Write is a list of 4-tuples [Q,X,Y,Qn] such that at Q and X, M may write Y, and change state to Qn without moving 
- Halt is a list of pairs [Q,X] such that at Q and X, M may halt

An FSM is a Tm where MLeft = [] = Write, and for every pair [Q,X] in Halt, X is # (blank).
