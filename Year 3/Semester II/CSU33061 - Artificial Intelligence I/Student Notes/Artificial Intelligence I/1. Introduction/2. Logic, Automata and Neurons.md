### Logic and the search for truth
Challenges to

#### Truth
Liar's paradox: "I am lying"

#### Sets
Russell's set $R = \{x | not \ x \in x\}$ 
$R \in R \Leftrightarrow not R \in R$

#### Search (one by one)
Cantor cannot count subsets of {0, 1, 2, ...}

#### Computability
##### Halting Problem
Given program P and data D, return either 0 or 1, where 1 indicates P halts on input D

**Turing's Theorem:** No Turing Machine computes HP!

proof is similar to Liar's Paradox, as below
![[Pasted image 20230127141308.png]]

###### Proof of uncomputability - probably doesnt matter
![[Pasted image 20230127141031.png]]

Then, P(A) just copies A, always outputting A,A. $\bar{P}$ negates this.

Given Turing machine P that takes 2 arguments, show P does not compute HP by defining a TM $\bar{P}$ such that
$$P(\bar{P},\bar{P}) \neq HP(\bar{P},\bar{P})$$
and

uses squiggly equals for $\bar{P}$ as it will not always succeed

Then, we can notice that

### Agent vs Environment

Also, the Turing machine ~= program

### Finite State Machines
fsm M is a triple [Trans, Final, Q0] where
1. Trans is a list of triples [Q,X,Qn] such that M may go from state Q to state Qn on seeing X
2. Final is a list of M's final (accepting) states
3. Q0 is M's initial state

#### Eg:
![[Pasted image 20230127142722.png]]
Trans = \[[q0, a, q0], [q0, b, q1], [q1, b, q1]\]
Final = \[q1\]
Q0 = q0

#### Strings to FSMs
![[Pasted image 20230127142835.png]]
```Prolog
% string2fsm(+String, ?TransitionSet, ?FinalStates)
% If it's
string2fsm([], [], [q0]). 
string2fsm([H|T], Trans, [Last]) :-
	mkTL(T, [H], [[q0, H, [H]]], Trans, Last).

% (make Trans Last) mkTL(+More, +LastSoFar, +TransSoFar, ?Trans, ?Last) 
% If there is no more, then the last so far and trans so far are correct
mkTL([], L, Trans, Trans, L). 

% Add H to last so far, add the transition to transitions so far
mkTL([H|T], L, TransSoFar, Trans, Last) :- 
	mkTL(T, [H|L], [[L,H,[H|L]]|TransSoFar], 
		Trans, Last). 
```

Recording the "state" as a history of items seen (in reverse)

Simplify by encoding q0 as []
```Prolog
% string2fsm(+String, ?TransitionSet, ?FinalStates)
% If it's
string2fsm(String, Trans, [Last]) :-
	mkTL(String, [], [], Trans, Last).

% (make Trans Last) mkTL(+More, +LastSoFar, +TransSoFar, ?Trans, ?Last) 
% If there is no more, then the last so far and trans so far are correct
mkTL([], L, Trans, Trans, L). 

% Add H to last so far, add the transition to transitions so far
mkTL([H|T], L, TransSoFar, Trans, Last) :- 
	mkTL(T, [H|L], [[L,H,[H|L]]|TransSoFar], 
		Trans, Last). 
```

##### States as histories works for *Finite Languages*, not anything more compelx
Not `a*bb*`

#### Exercise
Define a 4-ary predicate
```prolog
accept(+Trans,+Final,+Q0,?String)
``` 
that is true exactly when [Trans,Final,Q0] is a fsm that accepts String (encoded as a list).
```prolog
:- use_module(library(lists)).
% accept(+Trans,+Final,+Q0,?String)
% Accept if the last state is accepting
accept(_,Final,Q,[]):- member(Q,Final), !. 

accept(Trans, Final, Q, [H|T]):-
	findTrans(Trans, Q, H, NewQ), 
	accept(Trans, Final, NewQ, T).

% Find relevant Trans
findTrans([H|T], StartState, Input, EndState):-
	% If there is a transition from StartState with Input
	( prefix([StartState, Input], H), 
	% That gives the end state
	nth0(2, H, EndState) );
	% Otherwise, continue to look for the Transition
	findTrans(T, StartState, Input, EndState).
	
% query
accept([[q0,0,q1],[q0,1,q1],[q1,0,q0],[q1,1,q0]], [q1], q0, [1,0,0]).
```

### Agents from Neurons (Perceptrons)

If sum of the weights exceeds a bias, the output is 1. Otherwise it's 0.

rabin and scott removed the use of the internals of FSM, gave us what we have now, threw out neurons (kings)

Kleene invented Kleene star to look at nerve nets
