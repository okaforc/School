Cheating?

#### Eliza effect
Humans anthropomorphise computers!
So, use pattern matching/substitution to fake it! (in prolog)

#### ChatGPT (generative AI)
Fucked up assessment lmaoooo xd
Limitations: 
- Plausible sounding, but incorrect
- Makes probabilistic guesses based on examples
- Over capacity

### Agent and Environment
#### Weak AI - Chinese room argument

- Searle's thought experiment
- A clerk can follow instructions for communicating in Chinese without understanding Chinese
- __Weak AI:__ Mindless obedience, black box, just judged by actions

**Intelligence:** (abilities, goals, etc) -> action

#### Agent vs Environment
##### Agent
- Program
- Cognitive Revolution
- Hard wired
- Rationalist
- Nature
The Turing machine & specialised automaton

##### Environment
- Data/Big data
- Experience
- Empiricism
- Nurture
Learning from environment, trial & error

### Levels of intelligence
They sure do exist
\*bullshit\*, being persuasive
