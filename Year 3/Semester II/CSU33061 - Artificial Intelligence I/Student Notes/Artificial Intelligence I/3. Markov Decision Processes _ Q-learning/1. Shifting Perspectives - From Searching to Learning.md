## Heuristic under-estimating
This values the **settled past** (tracked by cost) as more valuable than an **uncertain future** (estimated by heuristic)

## A-star as a tweak of BFS
(Every node has at most 2 children)
It is a tree of branching factor *b*, can be counted by geometric series
$$
1+b+b^2+b^3+...+b^{n} = \Sigma^n_{k=0} b^k = \frac{1-b^(n+1)}{1-b}
$$

Different to bfs as there all arcs have cost 1, no heuristic cost.


## Changes being made while shifting perspective
1. From ~b=2 (each node having at most 2 children) 
	- $\rightarrow$ b = 1/2 (discounting the future, less branching factor)
2. From doing frontier search from a start point
	- $\rightarrow$ backing up from the goal
3. From arc with a cost
	- $\rightarrow$ action, with a reward
4. From *h*, a heuristic *cost* estimate we're trying to minimise
	- $\rightarrow$ *H*, a heuristic *reward* estimate we're trying to maximise
	- approximate $H=lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}H_n$
	- Based on look-ahead n
	- **learning** in stages
