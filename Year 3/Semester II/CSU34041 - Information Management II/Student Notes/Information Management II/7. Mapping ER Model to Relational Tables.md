## 1. Relational Schema Mapping
How to move from conceptual database design
*(Entity Relationship Model)*
$\rightarrow$ to a logical database design
*(Relational Database Schema)*

Follow a series of steps to map entity types, relationships, and attributes into relations.

## 2. Mapping Entity Types

For each entity type E in the ER diagram, create a relation R that includes 
- *all* simple attributes of E
- In composite attributes, include only simple component attributes

### Key Attributes
1. Choose one of the key attributes as primary key of R
2. Composite key attributes are included as a *composite primary key*
3. Extra key attributes included as secondary unique keys

### Example

## 3. Mapping Multivalued Attributes
1. For each multivalued attribute A, create a new relation R
2. New relation R includes
	- Attribute corresponding to A
	- Primary key K from relation, represents entity type A came from
		- becomes *foreign key* in R
	- *Primary key* of R is combination of A and K

## 4. Mapping Relationship
Need to map the relationship types:
- 1:1, One to One
- 1:N, One to Many
- M:N, Many to Many

### Mapping 1:1 Relationships
Two main approaches
For each binary 1:1 relationship type R
$\rightarrow$ identify relations S and T that correspond to entity types participating in R

#### Foreign Key Approach
Most useful and most commonly used
1. Choose one of the participating relations (S)
2. If possible, choose an entity type with *total participation* in R for S
3. Include primary key of T as *foreign key* in S
4. Include all simple attributes of the relationship type R as attribute of S

##### Example

#### Merged Relation Approach
Used when there is *total participation*
1. Merge (Two entity types S and T, and Relationship type R) $\rightarrow$ 1 relation V
2. V should include all simple component attributes of S, T, R.
3. This is possible as there is joint total participation, so tables have identical number of tuples at all times

##### Example

### Mapping 1:N Relationships
1. For each binary 1:N relationship type R
	$\rightarrow$ identify the relation S that corresponds to entity types on the N side of R, T is on the 1 side
2. Include primary key of T(1) as a foreign key of S(N)
3. Include any simple attributes of the relationship type R as attribute of S
	- Or a simple component attribute of composite attribute

#### Example

### Mapping Recursive Relationships
**Recursive relationships:** where an entity instance can refer to another instance of the same entity type

For each recursive relationship type R
1. Include primary key of T (relation representing the entity type involved) as a foreign key in T (same relation)
2. Include any simple attributes of the relationship type R as attributes of T
	- Or simple component attributes of a composite attribute

#### Example

### Mapping M:N Relationships
More complex to map than 1:1 or 1:N
- Each entity instance may reference many entity instances in the other participating entity type
- Can't use foreign key attribute in either participating entity
- Must create a new relation

For each binary M:N relationship type R
1. Create a new relation S to represent R
2. Include primary keys of relations (that represent participating entity types) as foreign key attributes in S
3. The combination of these foreign keys is the composite primary key of S
4. Include any simple attributes of relationship type R as attributes of S
	- or simple component attributes of a composite attribute
