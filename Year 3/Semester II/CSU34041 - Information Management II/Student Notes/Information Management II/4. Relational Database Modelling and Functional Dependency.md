## 1. Problems in Relational Models 
### Aims
- Show techniques to describe information in terms of table definitions and occurences.
- Guard against anomalies when we insert, delete or lose consistency of data in tables
- How do we know our tables are correct

### Relational Models: Key points
1. Ordering of rows is not significant 
2. Ordering of columns is not significant 
3. Each row/column intersection contains a single attribute value. (Multiple values not allowed)
4. Each row in a table must be distinct
	- Row can always be uniquely identified by quoting an appropriate combination of attribute values

A table conforming to these restrictions is called a ***normalised table***.

### Unnecessary Duplication
If we can delete a value in a cell, and still be able to work out what the value was, then that value was **unnecessarily duplicated**.

Creates problems when updating data as all copies of values must be updated when their values are changed.

### Example
Suppose a company called TechScience, wishes to create a database for managing its engineers and the engineering projects on which they work. 

Suggest a relational structure (i.e. table(s)) for storing Engineer employee ids, Engineer Employee Names, Project Ids and their Project Names. 

Assume TechEngineering has a policy that NO Engineer can work on more than one project at a time. But a Project can have multiple Engineers working on that project.

#### Possible solutions
##### Solution A: 
AllInformation (EngineerId, EngineerName, Project ID, ProjectName) 
![[Pasted image 20230208160724.png]]

###### Is there unnecessary duplication?
Yes - the ProjectID/ProjectName for 888/Ventilator could be removed from one tuple/row and you can figure out what's going on!


##### Solution B: 
Engineer (EngineerId,EngineerName) 
Project (Project ID, ProjectName, EngineerId) 
![[Pasted image 20230208161058.png]]

###### Is there unnecessary duplication?
Yes - the ProjectID/ProjectName for 888/Ventilator could be removed from one tuple/row and you can figure out what's going on!

##### Solution C: 
Engineer (EngineerId,EngineerName, Project ID) 
Project (Project ID, ProjectName) 
![[Pasted image 20230208161154.png]]

###### Is there unnecessary duplication?
No!

##### Solution D: 
Engineer (EngineerId,EngineerName) 
Project (Project ID, ProjectName) 
EngineerAllocationsToProjects (EngineerId, Project ID)
![[Pasted image 20230208161302.png]]

###### Is there unnecessary duplication?
No!

So, two have no unnecessary duplication. Either could be right!

## 2. Duplicate vs Redundant Data 
### Duplicate data
Occurs where an attribute (column) has two or more identical values

### Redundant data
Occurs if you can delete a value without information being lost.
$\rightarrow$ Redundancy is unnecessary duplication.

### Examples
#### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20230208161729.png]]
- Nut is duplicated
- *But* it's not redundant, if one of them were removed, information would be lost

#### Example 2
![[Pasted image 20230208162038.png]]
(Where S# is supplier)
- Suppliers can supply the same part
- P1/Bolt are duplicated
- They ARE redundant (remove one bolt)

### Eliminating Redundancy
(From [[#Example 2]])
We can't just delete values... instead, split into 2 tables.
![[Pasted image 20230208162502.png]]
- Eliminated redundancy by table splitting
	- P1 description appears once
	- Relationship by including part# in 2 tables
- Can't always see redundancy in a table, as table values can change
![[Pasted image 20230208162910.png]]
- Here looks like there is no redundancy, as it suggests no 2 suppliers can supply the same thing 
- So need to understand the underlying rules to eliminate redundancy!

### Repeating Groups
![[Pasted image 20230208163047.png]]
Given *each attribute must have at most one value in each row*, this is not possible (rows 2 and 4).

#### Problems
1. Table is an asymmetric representation of symmetrical data
2. Rows can be sorted by S#, but not P#
3. Rows are different lengths
	- Variation in number of p#s
	- If rows were fixed length, they'd need to be padded with NULL values

#### Elimination of Repeating Groups
##### Easy
Just write out the table using a vertical layout and fill in the blanks by duplicating the non- repeating data necessary:
![[Pasted image 20230208163445.png]]

Leads to redundancy...

##### Alternate
- Split table into two tables - repeating group appears in one table and rest of attributes in another
- Need to provide correspondence between tables by including a key attribute with the repeating group table
![[Pasted image 20230208163542.png]]

### Note that
- Snapshot of the table is an inadequate guide to presence/absence of redundant data
- Need to know underlying rules
- DBA must discover rules which apply to conceptual model

**It is not possible to tell by looking at the relational tables in a DB to determine if there is the potential for redundancy**

What is correctly formed table? 

## 3. Normal Form Databases 
### Codd's Normal Forms
Rules used to avoid anomalies when inserting or deleting values in tables.

#### 1st Normal Form (1NF)
A relation is in first normal form if 
1. The domain of each attribute contains only atomic (simple, non-divisible, etc.) values
2. The value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain

##### Test
Relation should have no 
- Multivalued attributes 
- Nested relations

##### Remedy to Normalise
Form new relations for each multivalued attribute or nested function

##### Example
| ID  | Name | Courses |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| 1   | A    | c1, c2  |
| 2   | E    | c3      |
| 3   | M    | c2, c3  |
In the above table, Course is a multi-valued attribute so it is not in 1NF. 
Below Table is in 1NF as there is no multi-valued attribute:
| ID  | Name | Courses |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| 1   | A    | c1      |
| 1   | A    | c2      |
| 2   | E    | c3      |
| 3   | M    | c2      |
| 3   | M    | c3      | 

#### 2nd Normal Form (2NF)
A relation is in 2nd normal form if, in addition to satisfying the criteria for 1st normal form, every non-key column is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key. Non-redund

**All requirements:**
1. The domain of each attribute contains only atomic values 
2. The value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain
3. Every non-key column is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key


##### Test
For relations where the primary key has multiple attributes, **no non-key attributes should be functionally dependant on a part of the primary key**.

##### Remedy to Normalise
Decompose and set up a new relation for each partial key with its dependant attributes.
Keep any relations with the original primary key, and any attributes which are fully functionally dependent on it.

##### Example
| Stu_ID | Course_ID | Course_Fee |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 1      | c1        | 1000       |
| 2      | c2        | 1500       |
| 1      | c4        | 2000       |
| 4      | c4        | 2000       |
| 4      | c1        | 1000       |
| 2      | c5        | 2000       |

In the above table, `Course_Fee` alone cannot decide the value of `Course_ID` or `Stu_ID`, and neither can any two decide the value of any other column. Therefore, `Course_Fee` is a **non-prime attribute**. However, `Course_ID` directly defines `Course_Fee`. Since `Course_Fee` is dependent on a proper subset of the primary key, and not the entire primary key, it is not in 2NF.
To convert it to 2NF, you can split the table into multiple tables for each primary key.

**Table 1**
| Stu_ID | Course_ID |
| ------ | --------- |
| 1      | c1        |
| 2      | c2        |
| 1      | c4        |
| 4      | c4        |
| 4      | c1        |
| 2      | c5        |

**Table 2**
| Course_ID | Course_Fee |
| --------- | ---------- |
| c1        | 1000       |
| c2        | 2000       |
| c3        | 1000       |
| c4        | 2000       |
| c5        | 2000          |


#### 3rd Normal Form
A relation is in 3rd Normal Form if, in addition to satisfying the criteria for 2nd Normal Form, no non-key attributes are transitively dependent upon the primary key. In other words, "every non-key attribute is dependent on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key."

**All requirements:**
1. The domain of each attribute contains only atomic values 
2. The value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain
3. Every non-key column is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key
4. No non-key attributes are transitively dependent upon the primary key

##### Test
Relation should not have a non-key attribute functionally determined by another non-key attribute (or a set of non-key attributes).

IE: no transitive dependency of a non-key attribute on the primary key.

##### Remedy to Normalise
Decompose and set up a relation that includes the non-key attribute(s) that functionally determine other non-key attributes

#### Boyce Codd Normal Form (or 3 $\frac{1}{2}$ normal form)
BCNF is a slightly stronger version of 3NF where **every [determinant](#determinants) must be a candidate [identifier](#Identifiers)**.
All attributes in a relation should be dependent on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key

**All requirements:**
1. The domain of each attribute contains only atomic values 
2. The value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain
3. Every non-key column is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key
4. No non-key attributes are transitively dependent upon the primary key
5. Every determinant must be a candidate identifier

##### Example
![[Pasted image 20230422144047.png | 500]]

In normalised form, this can be rewritten as:

![[Pasted image 20230422144124.png | 500]]

## 4. Determinants and Identifiers 
### Determinants
If there are rules such that duplicate values of attribute A are always associated with the same value of attribute B (within any given occurrence of the table) then attribute A is a determinant of attribute B. 

Can be written as
![[Pasted image 20230208164714.png]]

#### Example
If each possible p# value has precisely one associated part description value (i.e. P4 has just one description nut) then we can say that p# is a determinant of part description
![[Pasted image 20230208164744.png]]

Also, if each possible p# value has precisely one quantity in stock then we can say p# is a determinant of quantity in stock
![[Pasted image 20230208164806.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230208164902.png]]
Is P_Desc a determinant of P#? 
No, but with the rule given above, p# is a determinant of p_desc

Is P_Desc a determinant of Qty?
No, but with the rule given above, p# is a determinant of qty (apparently)

#### Superfluous Attribute
- If P# determines qty
	- Composite attribute {P#, P_Desc} also determines Qty
	- But P_Desc is superfluous
- We assume determinants do not contains any superfluous attributes

#### Determinacy Diagrams
![[Pasted image 20230208165850.png]]

##### Transistive determinants
If A is determinant of B & B is determinant of C, then A is determinant of C
![[Pasted image 20230208171318.png]]

##### Example
**Rules:**
1. Supplier identified by single S#
2. Part is identified by single P# 
![[Pasted image 20230208170753.png]]

3. Each supplier has only one SName but different suppliers may have same names
![[Pasted image 20230208170820.png]]

4. A given supplier supplies a given part in just one pack size
![[Pasted image 20230208170845.png]]

5. A supplier may supply many different parts in many different pack sizes
![[Pasted image 20230208170908.png]]

**Then, what determines SName?**
(as S# is the id for Suppliers) S#
![[Pasted image 20230208171015.png]]

**What determines Packsize?**
(As the supplier id alone might give multiple pack sizes, need to look at part number as well) The combination of S# and P#: {S#,P#}
![[Pasted image 20230208171210.png]]

**Combined**
![[Pasted image 20230208171705.png]]

### Identifiers
As **no two rows in a table can have identical values throughout**
$\rightarrow$ an individual row can always be identified by quoting the values of all its attributes (some values may not be needed).

Try to quote as few values as possible.

Where a composed attribute (multiple values) forms the identifier, no component part can be null. ([[3. Database Models#Entity Integrity Constraint]])

#### Example 1
Employee ( Employee#, Employee_name, Salary)

With rule: No two rows should have the same value for Employee#.

Then,  Employee# is the **row identifier** of the table.

#### More examples
![[Pasted image 20230208172104.png]]

## 5. Determinants and Redundancy 
Given a determinacy diagram we can detect and eliminate table structures which could contain redundant data

### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20230208172158.png]]
- Each customer# is associated with one salesman#
- BUT salesman# may be associated with several different customer#
- Therefore salesman# could have duplicate values
- But salesman# is a determinant of salesman name
- Therefore each occurrence of a duplicate salesman# value will be associated with the same salesman name => table can contain redundant values of salesman
![[Pasted image 20230208172323.png]]

Redundancy as salesman# is a determinant but not an identifier (salesman# determines customers but there’s a better way to identify them)

### Example 2
![[Pasted image 20230208172621.png]]
- Potential redundancy in values of P_desc and Unit_Price 
- P# is a determinant but not a candidate identifier! 
- Gives rise to Boyce-Codd Rule for detecting redundancy

## 6. Well-normalised tables
Boyce/Codd rule for determining redundancy is:
- "Every determinant must be a candidate identifier" 

A table which obeys this rule is said to be in Boyce / Codd normal form (BCNF) 

**“all attributes in a relation should be dependent on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key"**

### Transformation into BCNF
**Non identifying determinant:** A determinant which is not a candidate identifier

To transform a badly normalised (non BCNF) table into well normalised tables: Create new tables such that each non identifying determinant in the old table becomes a candidate identifier in a new table

#### Example
![[Pasted image 20230208172837.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208172844.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208172921.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208172953.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208173005.png]]
This is well-normalised form.

## 7. Fully-normalised tables 
Fully normalised tables are structured in such a way that they **cannot** contain redundant data

Generally, a well normalised table is also fully normalised, but not always! - so further normalisation may be desirable.

### Example 1
#### Badly normalised
![[Pasted image 20230208173250.png]]

#### Technically well-normalised
![[Pasted image 20230208173345.png]]
Contains redundant data
![[Pasted image 20230208173438.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208173502.png]]

#### Fully normalised
![[Pasted image 20230208173406.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230208173525.png]]

Basic error to be avoided is associating a determinant (order#) in customer_name table with the transitively dependent attribute customer_name.


## 8. Multivalued Determinacy 

### Example
A database storing books has the following rules: 
1. Each book has a unique book# 
2. Each author has a unique author# 
3. Every author has a name and every book has a title 
4. Each subject classification has a unique subject_name 
5. Book# does not distinguish an individual copy of a book, only an individual work 
6. A book may be written by several authors and be classified under several subject_names 
7. An author may write several books 
8. A subject_name may be applied to several books

#### Determinacy Diagram
![[Pasted image 20230208173717.png]]

#### Table Options
Author(<ins>author#</ins>, author_name)
![[Pasted image 20230208173741.png]]

#### Book example
Book# B15 is jointly authored by A2 and A5 and is classified under subject names biology & physics.
If every author of a given book is always associated with all the subjectnames under which the book is classified, then the attribute subject-name can contain certain redundant values
![[Pasted image 20230208173940.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208173956.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208174004.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208174015.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208174023.png]]

## 9. Advantages of Full normalisation
Eliminating redundancy already discussed

### Example of Bad
![[Pasted image 20230208174210.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230208174227.png]]

#### Deletion Side Effect
If you delete C2, deletes whole tuple.
Lose salesman information! 
(can't just delete C#, identifier)

#### Insertion side effect
Add salesman S3, named Hall. Can't do that without an associated customer!

### Model instead as

### Tutorial
[[Dependence Diagram Tutorial (1).pdf]]

#### Question
A football league is composed of four divisions (1,2,3,4) each containing many different teams, where each team has a unique name (e.g. Manchester united, Sheffield Wednesday etc.), and the number of points each team has amassed so far in the league competition. Information is also stored concerning each team’s captain, and home ground address. The names of all professional footballers (not unique) in the league and the teams for which they play is stored in the database. Also, maintained in the database for each player is a record of their ability in the following positions (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, striker) in a football team. A player can have the ability to play in more than one position. For example, a footballer named Alan Shearer, position = ‘Defender’, expertise = 2, however for position = ‘Striker’, expertise = 11, values > 0).  
1. Draw a Functional Dependence diagram for the relations in the above database stating any assumptions made in your solution. 
2. Derive a set of fully normalised relations (i.e. table names and attributes) from the dependence diagram, indicating clearly the primary key (candidate identifier(s)) and foreign keys of each relation. 
3. Write down any constraints on column values you may deem important

#### 1. Functional Dependency Diagram Methodology
##### Instructions
1. Underline all of the nouns in the description 
2. Create a spreadsheet (or similar on paper) of example data where each column is named by one of the nouns identified in (1) 
3. Check if there are any problems with identifying any of the nouns, hint: nouns with non unique values and add an identifier column for it, e.g. clientID if the problematic noun was client. 
4. Check if any other columns should correspond with that new identifying column and change the example data where appropriate. 
5. Go through each column and ask the question: “Does any other column(s) determine my value? The answer can be
	1. “no”,
	2. “yes, the … column determines my value” 
	3. “yes , the columns … and … determine my value” 
6. Write the name of the determining column(s) within a single box with an arrow pointing to the name of the other column (boxed on its own)

#### 2. Normalised Relations Modelling
##### Instructions
1. Using the functional dependency diagram from (A), identify all of the boxed attribute names that determine something else in the diagram, e.g. clientID determines clientname 
2. Work through each to create a relation or table with the primary key being the boxed attribute, B, e.g. the existence of clientID should indicate the need for a client table with clientID as the primary key. 
3. Add all determined from B as attributes in that table. 
4. Do the same for all other boxed attributes identified in (1) above, underlining the primary keys. 
5. Add a note to each table to say which attributes are foreign keys of others.

##### My solution
###### 1.
1. Footballer ID determines footballer name, midfielder, striker, goalkeeper, defender
2. Captain ID determines Team and vice versa 
3. Team determines Captain, Home Ground Address and Team
4. Team and division determine number of points

Division and team together are primary keys here

#### 3. Constraints Methodology
##### Instructions
1. Read through the question again but paying special attention to the sentences that add a constraint to the data in some way, e.g. if a client belongs to one of 5 user groups, a sensible constraint to add is that the values of Usergroup attribute must be the values, 1-5. 
2. Make a list of all constraints that should be applied.

##### My solution
1. Footballer ID must be unique
2. Abilities must be >0
3. Team names must be unique
4. Division must be between 1-4
5. Foreign keys must match up to valid primary keys

### Tutorial in class

#### Information after asking questions
1. Each team is only in one division
2. Each football player should just have skill and position, not each individual one

#### Question
A football league is composed of four divisions (1,2,3,4) each containing many different teams, where each team has a unique name (e.g. Manchester united, Sheffield Wednesday etc.), and the number of points each team has amassed so far in the league competition. Information is also stored concerning each team’s captain, and home ground address. The names of all professional footballers (not unique) in the league and the teams for which they play is stored in the database. Also, maintained in the database for each player is a record of their ability in the following positions (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, striker) in a football team. A player can have the ability to play in more than one position. For example, a footballer named Alan Shearer, position = ‘Defender’, expertise = 2, however for position = ‘Striker’, expertise = 11, values > 0).  
1. Draw a Functional Dependence diagram for the relations in the above database stating any assumptions made in your solution. 
2. Derive a set of fully normalised relations (i.e. table names and attributes) from the dependence diagram, indicating clearly the primary key (candidate identifier(s)) and foreign keys of each relation. 
3. Write down any constraints on column values you may deem important

#### 1. Functional Dependency Diagram Methodology
##### Instructions
1. Underline all of the nouns in the description 
2. Create a spreadsheet (or similar on paper) of example data where each column is named by one of the nouns identified in (1) 
3. Check if there are any problems with identifying any of the nouns, hint: nouns with non unique values and add an identifier column for it, e.g. clientID if the problematic noun was client. 
4. Check if any other columns should correspond with that new identifying column and change the example data where appropriate. 
5. Go through each column and ask the question: “Does any other column(s) determine my value? The answer can be
	1. “no”,
	2. “yes, the … column determines my value” 
	3. “yes , the columns … and … determine my value” 
6. Write the name of the determining column(s) within a single box with an arrow pointing to the name of the other column (boxed on its own)

##### My Solution
###### 1.
A football <u>league</u> is composed of four <u>divisions</u> (1,2,3,4) each containing many different <u>teams</u>, where each team has a unique name (e.g. Manchester united, Sheffield Wednesday etc.), and the <u>number of points</u> each team has amassed so far in the league competition.

The names of all professional <u>footballers</u> (not unique) in the league and the teams for which they play is stored in the database. Also, maintained in the database for each player is a record of their ability in the following positions (<u>goalkeeper</u>, <u>defender</u>, <u>midfielder</u>, <u>striker</u>) in a football team. A player can have the ability to play in more than one position. For example, a footballer named Alan Shearer, position = ‘Defender’, expertise = 2, however for position = ‘Striker’, expertise = 11, values > 0).

Added footballer ID, changed captain to captain id

###### 5. 
1. Division: no
3. Team: yes the column Captain ID determines my value
4. Number of points: yes the column Team ID determines my value
5. Captain ID: yes the column Team ID determines my value
6. Captain: yes the column Captain ID determines my value
7. Home Ground Address: yes the column team ID determines my value
8. Footballer ID: no
9. Footballer name: yes the column Footballer ID determines my value
10. Position: yes the columns Footballer ID and skill level determine my value
11. Skill level: yes the columns Footballer ID and position determine my value

**In class:** Just make shit up - "common sense"!
1. Teamname? APPARENTLY FOOTBALLER ID WTF
2. captain id? team name???? why????
3. Footballer id apparently determines nothing
4. Name? id
5. Homeground? team name
6. Division? team name
7. Points? team name
8. Skill level? footballer id and position
9. Position??? aparently nothing??????????

#### 2. Normalised Relations Modelling
##### Instructions
1. Using the functional dependency diagram from (A), identify all of the boxed attribute names that determine something else in the diagram, e.g. clientID determines clientname 
2. Work through each to create a relation or table with the primary key being the boxed attribute, B, e.g. the existence of clientID should indicate the need for a client table with clientID as the primary key. 
3. Add all determined from B as attributes in that table. 
4. Do the same for all other boxed attributes identified in (1) above, underlining the primary keys. 
5. Add a note to each table to say which attributes are foreign keys of others.

##### My solution
###### 1.
1. Footballer ID determines footballer name
2. Footballer ID and Skill level determine position
3. Footballer ID and position determine skill lelvel
4. Captain ID determines Team and vice versa 
5. Team determines Captain ID, Home Ground Address, Division, and number of points

###### Footballer
| ID (primary key) | Footballer name | Team (foreign key) |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 1                | Name 1          | Manchester United  |
| 2                | Name 2          | Manchester United  |
| 3                | Name 3          | Wednesday          | 

###### Skills
| Footballer ID (foreign key) | Position | Skill Level |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1                           | Midfield | 3           |
| 1                           | Defender | 8           |
| 2                           | Striker  | 9           |
| 3                           | Midfield | 10          | 
Position and footballer ID are primary keys together here

###### Team
| Team (primary key) | Captain ID (foreign key) | Home Ground Address | Division | Number of points |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Manchester United  | 1                        | Manchester          | 1        | 84396            |
