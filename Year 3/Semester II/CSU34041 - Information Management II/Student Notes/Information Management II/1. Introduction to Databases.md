### What is Data?
Information!
Usually for an application (booking, social media, etc)

#### What is a Database?
- An organised collection of information/data
	- `A database is a persistent collection of related data supporting several different applications within an organisation`
- Organised to:
	- Model aspects of reality
	- In a way which is **useful** (supports processes)
- Helpful to manage data
	- Duplication of data reduced
	- Eliminated redundancies (wasteful of storage, inefficient, inconsistencies)
	- Data from all applications is integrated and stored once in the DB
	- All applications access same copy of data

#### What is Metadata?
Context for data!
![[Pasted image 20230125163844.png]]
Can include:
- Data type
- Name of element
- Size
- Restrictions
- Etc

Can be used at any level of aggregation

##### Metadata Management
(in Database approach)
- Store metadata centrally in the catalogue
- Eg for patient:

### Data needed for an Application
What data do you need to store?
What kind of storages?
1. Relational
2. NoSQL (blogging, newsfeed, large amounts of data)
3. File storage

#### Relational Databases
- Information organised into 2D tables
- Cells can be empty (**null**), but should be few
- Assumes data mostly fits a 2D structure
	- Columns have headers containing name of data in the column
	- Rows have unique identifiers
- Likely a number of tables

##### Examples
Student records.
What tables???
- Students
- Modules
- Enrolments

So, for people!
![[Pasted image 20230125162818.png]]
Also want details on their cats?
![[Pasted image 20230125162853.png]]
Reference the person's id!

How does data in our application fit together in a meaningful way?

Aim to achieve these things:
1. **Specify** the information needed (design database)
2. **Store** information about students
3. **Model** the relationship between elements (eg students and modules, who is enrolled in which module

Relations are modelled by asking `which columns in table A relate to another column in table B`! 
Then, `How are they related?`
1. **One to many:** People have multiple pets, pets can't have multiple owners
2. **Many to many:** Students are allowed to enrol in multiple modules!

### Database Management Systems
DBMS
**Goal:** simplify storage of and access to data.

Support:
- Definition
- Manipulation
- Querying

For one or many DBs
![[Pasted image 20230125164315.png]]

#### They provide...
- Efficient, reliable and secure management of large amounts of persistent data.
- Languages for defining the DB
	- Data definition languages
- Languages for storing, retrieving and updating data in DB
	- Data manipulation languages

#### Examples
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
Oracle, IBM-DB2, SQLServer

### More about Databases
Stops duplication (as above)
![[Pasted image 20230125164652.png]]

#### Data Independence
DBMS support **logical data independence**
	Allows the view of the data to be changed and data **added** without affecting its underlying organisation

DBMS support **physical data independence**
	Insulate the way data is viewed by applications/users from the way it is physically stored.

#### Data Integrity
**Consistency** and **accuracy** of the data in the database. (redundancy badddd)
Key thing for DBMS to support!

Databases model parts of the real world where rules apply!
- DBMS express rules by **integrity constraints**
- Validation of data values by DBMS
- Simultaneous updates fucks with this
	- Requires concurrency control

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Databases
#### Advantages
- Search and Retrieval Capabilities 
	- Filtered according to specific needs 
- Reduced Data Redundancy
	- Ease of Update 
- Greater Data Integrity 
- Independence from Applications
- Concurrent Access 
- Improved Data Security 
- Reduced Costs for Data Entry, Storage and Retrieval

#### Disadvantages
- Some training required for use
- Complex and time consuming to design
- Cost: software, hardware, training
- Loss of autonomy because of centralised control
- Inflexibility: complexity or bad database for application
### Database Languages
Programming languages used to:
1. Define a database
	Entities and relationships between them
2. Manipulate its content
	Insert new data and update or delete existing data
3. Conduct queries
	Request information based on defined criteria

SQL is most common!

#### SQL
Split into 4 sets of commands

##### Data Definition 
- Collect of imperative verbs to modify the ***schema*** of the database.
- Can **add, change** or **delete** definitons of tables or objects.
- Statements can be freely mixed with other SQL statements 

##### Data Modification/Manipulation
- Data change statements 
- Modify stored data (not schema)
- **Insert, delete**, and **update** data in tables of a database

##### Data Query
- Formulate requests and generate reports
- Primary command: SELECT
	- Query/retrieve data from a table
	- May retrieve from specified columns or all
	- May have specific criteria to be met before data is returned

##### Data Control
Not mentioned lmao

### More *more* about Databases 
#### Transactions
- To group actions which must be atomic
- **Guarantees** to move DB content from one consistent state to another
- Isolates actions from parallel execution of other actions/transactions
- Ensures DB is recoverable in case of failure

#### Backup and Recovery
Ensures DB can be returned to a stable state in case of Transaction failure, System errors, System crash, Data Corruption, Disk failure.

#### Database Users
1. DBMS implementer
2. Database designer
3. Database application developer
4. Database administrator - overall responsibility for DB
	- Access constraints
	- Backup/recovery
	- Monitoring, etc

#### Emergent Databases
1. XML databases - document oriented
2. NoSQL databases - web scale, non-relational, open source
3. In Memory - not on disk
4. Massively parallel processing (MPP) databases 
5. Online analytical processing (OLAP) databases
