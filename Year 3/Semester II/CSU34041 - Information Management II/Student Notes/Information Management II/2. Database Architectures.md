### 1. Database Systems
(DBS) Made of:
- DBMS
- DB
	- application data
	- associated metadata
- Application programs
Metadata and data stored seperately

### 2. Database Architecture
Or DBMS Architecture

- Database users are provided an abstract view of the data, hides certain details of how it is stored
- DBMS describes db at 3 levels
	1. Internal (physical)
	2. Conceptual (logical)
	3. External (view)
- **Three level DBMS architecture**

![[Pasted image 20230130131130.png]]
#### Internal (physical) level
- Lowest level
- Internal Schema (below) describes how it is physically stored and organized on the storage medium
- Various aspects are considered for optimal runtime and storage:
	- Storage space allocation techniques
	- Access paths, like indices
	- Data compression and encryption

#### Conceptual (logical) level
- Logical structure of full database
- Conceptual Schema describes what data is stored in the database and the relationships among the data without any concern for the physical implementation 
- This is the overall view of the database and includes all the information that is going to be represented in the database

#### External (view) level
- Highest level of abstraction - deals with userâ€™s view of database 
- Most users and applications do not require access to the all data stored in the database 
- External Schemas (or User Views) describe a part of the database for a particular group of users or applications 
- This is a powerful and flexible security mechanism, as parts of the database are hidden from certain users 
	- User is not aware of the existence of any attributes that are missing from the view

### 3. Database Schemas
- Each level of architecture consists of 1+ views of the underlying data
- Views are described by *schemas* (meta data)
- DB consists of
	- physical data 
	- an internal schema (aka physical schema)
	- a conceptual schema (aka logical schema) 
	- several external schemas
- Stored in the system catalog

### 4. Database Components
![[Pasted image 20230130131644.png]]

#### DBMS DDL(Data Definition Language) Components
![[Pasted image 20230130131720.png]]
**DDL compiler** processes schema definitions and stores them in catalogue.
**Catalogue** contains information like
- Names and sizes of files
- Names and Data Type of Data Items
- Storage details 
- Mapping information among Schemas
- Constraints
- ...

#### DBMS Storage & Physical Database Components 
The physical Database is usually stored on Hard Disk
![[Pasted image 20230130131941.png]]

**Stored Data Manager (SDM)** controls access to DBMS information on disk (including buffer management).

#### DBMS User Interface Components
**Users**
- Casual
- Application Programmers
- Parametric Users
- DBA Staff
Different interfaces for each type of user
![[Pasted image 20230130132040.png]]

##### Casual Users 
- Use interactive query interface
- Query compiler parses and validates submitted query
- Internal query is processed for query optimisation
	- Consults DBMS catalogue
	- Generates Executable code

##### Programmer Interface (and parametric)
- Application programmers need to access DB
- Precompiler extracts DML (data manipulation language) commands from host language program
- Extracted commands sent to DML compiler
- Rest of program sent to Host language compiler
- Object code for DML commands and the rest of the program are linked forming a canned transaction 
	- The executable code of a canned transaction calls the run-time processor 
	- Canned transactions are used by parametric users

#### DBMS Compiled Application Components
Object code for DML commands and the rest of the program are linked forming a canned transaction 
 - The executable code of a canned transaction calls the run-time processor 
 - Canned transactions are used by parametric users

#### Runtime Components
- Run-time Database Processor handles all Database access at run-time: 
	- Privileged Commands 
	- Executable Queries 
	- Canned Transactions 
- Utilises and Updates the Catalogue 
- May be responsible for Buffer Management 
- Manages Concurrency Control and Backup and Recovery as part of Transaction Management

### 5. System Catalogue & Data Dictionary
DDL (and **system catalogue**), care about SYNTACTIC definition.

Data dictionary gives SEMANTIC support
- Accessed directly by users (DBA - database administrator)
- Catalogue accessed by DBMS

#### Examples
![[Pasted image 20230130132752.png]]

#### Integrated DB and Data dictionary
- Majority of DBMS have an integrated Data dictionary
- Integral part - documents meta data
- Description not compulsory but wise
- Generally fully active - accessed at run time

#### Independant Data Dictionary systems
- Doesn't seem to be a good reason to use them ("nothing springs to mind")
- Independent, free standing performing its own data management
- Passive
	- No run time link
	- Has its own system catalogue
- Often generates metadata automatically for DBMS in the form of DDL
	- Ensures consistency between Data Dictionary and System catalogue

#### Data Dictionary System
Should store and manage
1. Descriptions of the **database schemas**
2. Detailed information on **physical database design**
	- Storage structures
	- Access paths
	- File and record sizes
3. Descriptions of types of **database users**, their **responsibilities** and **access rights**
4. High level descriptions of **transactions**, **applications**, and the **relationship of users to transactions**
5. The **relationship** between **database transactions** and the **data items** referenced by them
6. The **history** of any changes made to the database and applications, and documentation for the reasons these changes were made
