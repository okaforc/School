## Conceptual Design and Conceptual Schema
### Conceptual Design
- Process uses a high level conceptual data model
- Creates conceptual scheme for a database
	- In this case, the conceptual schema is the Relational Model
- Part of the **requirements analysis process**

### Conceptual Schema
- Concise description of the data requirements of the user, incl descriptions of:
	- Entity types (correspond closely to a class in OO programming)
	- Relationships
	- Constraints

- Does not include any implementation details
	- Use to communicate with non-technical users!
	- Used as a reference to ensure all data requirements met, no conflicts
- Part of physical and logical data independence

## Entity Relationship Model
- Abstract and high level conceptual representation of information
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams:** diagram of ER model
- Support conceptual design of databases, help produce conceptual schema
- Describes data as
	- Entities
	- Relationships
	- Attributes

### Entities
- Basic object that an ER diagram represent!
- An entity is a real-world object with an independent existence (physical/conceptual)
- Each entity has attributes (properties) that describe the real world object

### Attributes
Several types!

#### Simple vs Composite Attributes
##### Composite
Can be divided into smaller sub parts
- Name, address...
Can be hierarchical
- Apartment number, Building number, Street

##### Simple
Not divisible $\rightarrow$ simple, atomic
- Movie, Age

#### Single-valued vs Multi-valued Attributes
##### Single-valued
Most attributes
- PPSN, Age

##### Multi-valued
Some attributes have a *set* of values for an entity
ATTRIBUTE FROM A SET OF POSSIBLE VALUES
- Genre for Movie, Colour for Car
- Note: some entities may have one value while others have multiple

#### Stored vs Derived Attributes
Sometimes, 2+ attributes are related.

##### Eg: Age from Birth Date
Eg:
- Age, birth date
- Age can be calculated from todays date and a person's DOB
Then,

- Age is a ***derived*** attribute
- Age is ***derivable*** from BirthDate
- Birth Date is a ***stored*** attribute

##### Total Employees from Sum
Some attributes can be derived from information in related entities, rather than attributes 
- If a number_of_employees attribute was associated with a CINEMA entity 
- This could be derived by totaling the number of employee entries stored in the EMPLOYEE entity

##### In Diagram

### Entity Types
- ER diagrams don't show single instances of entities (or relations)
- Show entity types
	- Entity identified by its name and attributes
	- Eg, MOVIE could be an entity type
	- All movie entities have same attributes, each instance has its own *values*
- **Entity set:** The collection of all instances of a particular entity type in a database.

#### ER Diagram Example
![[Pasted image 20230313132722.png]]
Title is the attribute, MOVIE is the entity type!

![[Pasted image 20230313132804.png]]
*Any multi-valued attributes?*
Genre, Director

*Any composite attributes?*
Apparently just Release Date
![[Pasted image 20230313133052.png]]

### Key Attributes
Each entity type usually has an attribute for which each entity in a set has a unique value (key)
**Key attribute:** An attribute whose values are used to uniquely identify each entity

**Composite key attribute:** Where more than one attribute is used to form the key

- Specifying the key attribute places a uniqueness constraint on the entity type. Must hold for all instances 
- Derived from real world requirements 

#### In Diagram
![[Pasted image 20230313133315.png]]

Can have more than 1 key attribute, **not composite**
![[Pasted image 20230313133513.png]]
(Note there is no primary key here, they are both keys)

## Relationships
Captures how 2+ entity types are related to each other

Whenever an attribute of an entity type refers to another entity type, a relationship exists
We had implicit relationships

Can be informally thought of as a verb, linking 2 or more nouns from the world
1. A “manages” relationship between an employee and a department
2. A “performs” relationship between an artist and a song 
3. A “proved” relationship between a mathematician and a theorem


### Relationship Types
Relationships have a *type*, shown in ER diagram

Collection of all instances of a relationship type is a *relationship set*

Related entity types *participate in a relationship type*

#### Formal
Each relationship instance $r_i$ is an association of entities, association includes exactly 1 entity from each participating entity type.

#### Diagram Notation
![[Pasted image 20230315161421.png]]

#### Degree of Relationship
Number of entity types that participate.

Degree 2: *binary*
Degree 3: *ternary*:
![[Pasted image 20230315161534.png]]

#### Relationship Roles
Each entity type plays a particular role, role name optionally added to clearly identify
![[Pasted image 20230315161652.png]]

#### Recursive Relationships
![[Pasted image 20230315161718.png]]
Both employee and supervisor are members of the same entity set!


### Constraints
- Limit possible combination of entities that can participate in a relationship
- Determined by real-world requirements

#### Cardinality Constraints
Max number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in
![[Pasted image 20230315162034.png]]

##### Cardinality ratios
1. 1:1 - One to One
2. 1:N - One to Many
3. M:N - Many to Many

##### Examples
![[Pasted image 20230315162305.png]]
1:1 - One to One

![[Pasted image 20230315162325.png]]
M:N - Many to Many

#### Participation Constraints
Specify *minimum* number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in
Either
1. Total participation
2. PArtial participation

**Formally:** specify if the existence of an entity depends on its being related to another entity via the relationship type

##### Total participation
Every employee **must** work in a department
The participation of EMPLOYEE in WORKS is called total participation
- every entity in the total set of employee entities must be related to a department entity via the WORKS relationship type
AKA *existence dependency*
![[Pasted image 20230315162852.png]]

##### Partial

### Relationship Type Attributes
Relationship types can have attributes!
![[Pasted image 20230315162919.png]]

#### Migration to entities
These relationship type attributes can be migrated to participating entities for relationships with a cardinality of 1:1 or 1:N
##### 1:1
![[Pasted image 20230315162950.png]]

##### 1:N
![[Pasted image 20230315163004.png]]
1:N can only migrate to N side (where 1 manages *N*)

##### N:M
![[Pasted image 20230315163102.png]]
Entity cannot be migrated

### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20230315163141.png]]
#### Show?
screening has 1 movie, movie has N screenings
Screening must have a movie
![[Pasted image 20230315163305.png]]

#### Display?
Screening N: Screen 1
Screening must have a screen
![[Pasted image 20230315163451.png]]

#### Locale?
Screen N: Theatre N
Theatre must have a screen, vv
![[Pasted image 20230315163653.png]]
