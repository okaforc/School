## Integrity vs Security
### Integrity
- *Accidental* corruption
- Using Integrity Contstraints

### Security
- *Deliberate* corruption
- Uses
	- Security Policies
	- Access Control

## Access Control
- Prevent unauthorised persons from accessing the system 
	- to obtain information 
	- to make malicious changes 
- DBMS can restrict access to the DB 
	- User Accounts 
	- Privileges 
	- Security Levels

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Responsible for
- User Account Creation
	- Encrypted table maintained by the DBMS 
- Privilege Granting and Revocation 
	- Discretionary Access Control 
- Security Level Assignment 
	- Mandatory Access Control 
- Role-Based Access

### Discretionary Access Control
#### Privileges
Account privileges can be given at 2 levels
1. Account level
	- DBA can specify the privileges *each account* holds
	- Independent of the relations in database
2. Relation level
	- DBA can control privilege to access each individual relation or view in the database

##### Account Level Privileges
Apply to capabilites provided to an account
Eg:
- `CREATE SCHEMA` 
- `CREATE TABLE` 
- `CREATE VIEW`
- `ALTER`
- `DROP`

##### Relation Level Privileges
- Specified on *entire relations* or *specific attributes*
	- Determine which operations can be peformed
- Each relation has an owner
	- Usually account which created the tab;e
	- This account controls granting and revoking of privileges to other accounts for that table

###### Privilege Types
1. Read privilege - gives an account the ability to use SELECT to retrieve rows from this relation
2. Modification Privilege - gives an account the ability to use INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE to modify rows in this relation
3. Reference Privilege - gives an account the ability to refer to this relation when specifying integrity constraints

#### Views
- Important discretionary authorisation mechanism
- Allow owner of relation to grant *partial access* to information in a relation
	- Access to restricted set of attributes
	- Access to restricted set of rows
- *View* acts as new relation in DB

##### In Code
```sql
CREATE VIEW PopularBooks AS SELECT ISBN, Title, Author, PublishDate FROM Books WHERE IsPopular = 1;
```
#### Granting Privileges
The owner of a relation 
- automatically has all the relation privileges granted to them 
- can use the GRANT command to specify user privileges for that relation

##### In Code
```sql
GRANT privilege TO user;
```
or
```sql
 GRANT privilege ON relation TO user;
```

#### Revoking Privileges
Remove a privilege from a particular user. Useful for
- temporary access 
- abuse of privilege

##### In Code
```sql
REVOKE privilege FROM user;
```
or
```sql
REVOKE privilege ON relation FROM user;
```
#### Propogation of Privileges
When owner of relation R grants privileges to R to another user, that can be granted with or without GRANT OPTION (with means new user can grant that privilege to other users)

##### In Code
```sql
GRANT privilege ON relation TO user WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

##### Dangers of Propogation
1. **A** owns relation *R*
2. **A** grants **B** DELETE privilege on *R* with GRANT OPTION
3. **A** grants **C** DELETE privilege on *R* with GRANT OPTION
4. **B** and **C** both grant **D** DELETE privilege on *R*
5. **B** revokes DELETE privilege from **D**
6. **D** continues to have DELETE privilege from **C**

##### Example
1. DBA makes four user accounts - James, Victoria, Henry, George
2. DBA only wants J to be able to create relations in DB
`GRANT CREATE TABLE TO James;`
3. J can now create tables, can't grant that ability to others
	1. Creates 2 tables![[Pasted image 20230417114308.png]]
	2. Owns these, has all relation privileges
4. J wants to grant H ability to insert, retrieve and delete rows in these tables, not able to pass it on
`GRANT INSERT, SELECT, DELETE ON Land, Lords TO Henry;`
5. J wants to grant Victoria ability to retrieve info from either table, trusts her to pass it on
`GRANT SELECT ON Land, Lords TO Victoria WITH GRANT OPTION;`
6. V can now propagate this privilege to other user accounts using the GRANT command
	1. Wants to give to G
	2. `GRANT SELECT ON Lords TO George;`
7. J revokes SELECT privilege on Lords from Victoria
	1. `REVOKE SELECT ON Lords FROM Victoria`
	2. DBMS must now automatically revoke the SELECT privilege from George as it was granted to him by Victoria, who no longer has the privilege
8. J wants to give back ability to see Lords information, and able to propogate it
	1. But! only name, age, address of Lords with "Victoria Cross"
```sql
CREATE VIEW SimpleVictoriaCross 
AS SELECT Name, Age, Address 
FROM Lords 
WHERE Decoration="Victoria Cross";

GRANT SELECT ON SimpleVictoriaCross TO Victoria WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
9. Wants to grant Henry option to update Salary field in Lords table
`GRANT UPDATE (Salary) ON Lords TO Henry`

- UPDATE and INSERT are examples of privileges that can be specified on attribute(s) 
- DELETE and SELECT are not attribute specific 
- That functionality is handled using Views

### Mandatory Access Control
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) classifies data and users based upon security levels 
- can be combined with discretionary access control 
- desirable in government, military and intelligence

Not commonly available in Commercial DBMS
- Some companies (eg Oracle) have special versions for governments with MAC

#### Implementation
##### Security Levels
Simplest example is
- Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Unclassified
- TS >= S >= C >= U

##### Applying Security Levels
Each *subject* and *object* is given a security level 
- Subject is said to be given access to an object

- **Subject** (User Account, Application Program…) 
- **Object** (Relation, Tuple, Attribute, View, Operation…)

The security level of the subject is compared with that of the object for the DBMS to decide if the action is permitted

### Discretionary vs Mandatory Access Control
Trade-off between Security and Applicability
#### Discretionary
1. Flexible
2. Complex to Manage
3. Vulnerable to malicious attacks

#### Mandatory
1. Rigid
2. Very secure

### Role base Access Control
- Privileges and other permissions are associated with organisational roles rather than individual user accounts 
- Created in SQL using
	- `CREATE ROLE`
	- `DESTROY ROLE`
- GRANT and REVOKE used to allocate privileges to creates roles
- Users allocated to roles
	- `GRANT role TO user`
	- Multiple individuals can be assigned to 1 role
	- Any individual assigned to a role automatically has the privileges associated with that role
	- An individual can be assigned to multiple roles

## Security Databases
- Ensuring security for large DBs is an important and difficult task 
- Many different issues involved 
	- legal, social, ethical etc. 
- Most countries have General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) 
	- requires holders of personal information to take reasonable precautions to ensure that there is no unauthorised access to the data
