[[CSU34041 09 Weak and Enhanced ER Modelling(1).pdf]]

## Weak Entities
1. Entities without key attributes - entity whose tuples cannot be identified by the attributes in that entity
2. Identified by their relation to specfic entities *from another entity type* in combination with one of their own entity types
3. Other entity is called *identifying* or *owner entity*
4. Relationship which relates weak entity to identifying entity is *identifying relationship* of the weak entity
5. A weak entity ALWAYS has a *total participation contraint w.r.t. its identifying relationship* (as the weak entity can't be identified without an owner)

### Example
![[Pasted image 20230417180634.png]]

1. Two entities
	1. EMPLOYEE 
	2. DEPENDENT
2. Each Employee has attributes Ssn, Bdate, etc
3. Each Dependent has Name, BDate, Relationship
4. Note: as two dependents of two different Employees can have the same Fname, Bdate and Relationship → no identifying attribute occurs in the DEPENDENT entity
5. => Dependents identified after determining the employee entity to which it is related
6. Each employee entity **owns** the dependent entity it relates to

### Weak Entity Type
- Weak entity normally has a *partial key* - attribute/set of attributes which uniquely identify weak entities related to the same owner entity
- Here, that is `Fname` - we assume within the family of a employee, no two dependent family members have the same FName

### Example - Movie ER Model
SCREENING can be a weak entity, with Movie as its identifying/owner entity.
This assumes no 2 screenings of the same movie at the same time.

## Enhanced Entity Relationships (EERs)
Contains all modelling concepts of ER with additional representation of
1. Subclass (and specialization)
2. Superclass (and generalization)
3. Union type (or category)
Important for attribute and relationship inheritance

### Entity Type
- Entity type used to represent both
	1. Type of entity 
	2. Entity set or collection of entities of a type that exist in that DB
- EG: entity type EMPLOYEE describes
	1. Types (attributes, relations) of each employee entity
	2. Current set of EMPLOYEE entity instances in the DB

### Subclass/Superclass
- Want to represent subgroups/subtypes of EMPLOYEE?
	- SECRETARY, ENGINEER, MANAGER, etc
- Each of these subgroupings is a ***subclass*** or ***subtype*** of EMPLOYEE
- The EMPLOYEE entity type is a ***superclass*** or ***supertype*** of the subclasses
- The relationship: 
	- ***superclass-subclass relationship***
	- or **is a** relationship (every instance of the subclass is also an instance of the superclass)

![[Pasted image 20230418185733.png]]

#### Notes
- All entities which are subclasses are also instances of the superclass 
	- Inherit attributes from superclass
	- eg: SECRETARY is also an EMPLOYEE
	- An instance of a subclass represents the same real-world instance of a superclass entity
	- An instance of a subclass CANNOT only exist as a subclass instance, MUST also be a superclass instance
- A subclass instance can optionally be an instance of another subclass
	- eg: SECRETARY can also be a SALARIED_EMPLOYEE

#### Inheritance relationship
1. An instance of a subclass inherits all attributes of the instance of a superclass
2. An instance of a subclass also inherits all the relationships in which the superclass participates

#### Specialisation/Generalisation
**Specialisation:** going from a more general superclass to subclass.
**Generalisation:** going from subclass(es) entities to a superclass entity

#### Why?
Useful where certain attributes apply to some but not all instances of an entity
- SECRETARY has Languages
- ENGINEER has Eng_Type

## Constraints on Specialisations/Generalisations
### Predicate defined
Sometimes, we can determine which entities will be instances of which subclass 
- Place condition on some attribute of the superclass
- These are ***predicate defined*** or **condition defined**
![[Pasted image 20230419103738.png]]

### User Defined
- Not all subclass instances can be determined by a condition
- Instances of subclasses defined as entities populated into database
- These are ***user-defined***

### Total or Completeness in subclasses
- Sometimes, want to ensure an instance of a superclass is at least one in a set of superclasses
- Use double line for toal participation
- Here, EVERY Employee MUST ALSO BE either a SALARIED EMPLOYEE or an HOURLY EMPLOYEE

## Mapping EERs to relations
Several options, we use Elmasri & Navathe Chpt 8.2

### Technique
1. Suppose 
	- `C` is the superclass with attributes `(k, a1, ..., an)` 
	- `C` has `m` subclasses `{S1, S2, ..., Sm)`
	- `k` is the primary key of superclass `C`

2. Create a relation `L` to represent the attributes which are *only* in superclass `C`
	- Attributes of `L` are `(k, a1, ..., an)` 
	- Primary key of `L` is `k`

3. Create a relation `Li` for each subclass `Si`, 1≤i≤m
	- With the attributes `{k}`$\cup$ `{attributes of Si}`
	- Primary key of `Li` is `k`

### Example
![[Pasted image 20230419104729.png]]

#### Create relation L for Superclass
`EMPLOYEE(JobType,`<u>SSN</u>`, BDate, FName, MInt, LName)`
- Created relation for superclass EMPLOYEE from all attributes of superclass
- Primary key of superclass is SSN

#### Create Li for each subclass
##### L1 - Secretary
`SECRETARY(`<u>SSN</u>`)`
`SECRETARY_LANGUAGES(`<u>SSN</u>`,Language)`

##### L2 - Technician
`TECHNICIAN(`<u>SSN</u>`, Tgrade)`

##### L3 - Engineer
`ENGINEER(`<u>SSN</u>`, Eng_Type)`

##### L4 - Manager
`MANAGER(`<u>SSN</u>`, MgrBonus)`

##### L5 - Salaried Employee
`SALARIED_EMPLOYEE(`<u>SSN</u>`, Salary)`

##### L6 - Hourly Employee
`HOURLY_EMPLOYEE(`<u>SSN</u>`, Pay_Scale)`


#### Finish off 
##### Project
`PROJECT(`<u>ProjID</u>`, ProjName)`

##### Project Management
`MANAGES_PROJECT(`<u>ProjID</u>`,`<u>SSN</u>`)`

##### Trade Union
`TRADE_UNION(`<u>TUnionName</u>`, ContactPhoneNumber)`

##### Trade Union Employees
`BELONGS_TO_UNION(`<u>TUnionName</u>`,`<u>SSN</u>`)`
