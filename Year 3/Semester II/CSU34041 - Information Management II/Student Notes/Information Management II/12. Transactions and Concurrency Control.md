[[CSU 34041 - 12 - Transactions and Concurrency(1).pdf]]

## Introduction
Real world database systems (eg airline, credit card, online shopping)
- Potentially have thousands of users
- Performing operations simultaneously
- Operations can be complex, involving several seperate actions
- Eg: Create booking, update remaining seats, charge credit card, issue confirmation

Transactions (a logical unit of DB processing that must be completed in its entirety to ensure correctness, atoms) and Concurrency Control (used when two operations try to access the same data at the same time) are ways a DB manages complex processes and multi-user interactions


## 1. Transaction
- Includes 1+ DB access operations
	- Insertion, Deletion, Modification, Retrieval
- Two types
	1. Read-Only Transactions: where the DB operations retrieve data, but don’t update any information
	2. Read-Write Transactions: where DB is updated

### 1. Form of a Transaction
```sql
START_TRANSACTION
	READ or WRITE operation1
	READ or WRITE operation2
	...
	READ or WRITE operationn
END_TRANSACTION
COMMIT or ROLLBACK
```

#### End of a Transaction
Signalled by either commit (successful) or rollback/abort (unsuccessful)

1. **Commit** completes the current transaction, making its changes *permanent*
2. **Rollback** will *undo* the operations in the current transaction, cancelling the changes made to the DB

### 2. Transaction Failure (Reasons)
1. System *crash* - Hardware, Software or Network Error
2. Transaction *error* - divide by zero, incorrect attribute reference, incorrect parameter value
3. *Checks* failing within the transaction - insufficient funds to make a withdrawal

### 3. Transaction Properties
All transactions should possess ACID properties

#### 1. Atomicity
- A transaction is an atomic unit of processing 
- Either be performed in its entirety or not performed at all

#### 2. Consistency preservation
- A transaction should preserve the consistency of the DB 
- It should take the database from one consistent state to another

#### 3. Isolation
- A transaction should appear as though it is being executed in isolation 
- The execution of a transaction should not be interfered with by any other transactions executing concurrently

#### 4. Durability (permanency)
- The changes applied by a committed transaction must persist in the database 
- These changes must not be lost because of any failure

## 2. Concurrency Control

### 1. What goes wrong?
Consider these 2 transactions
![[Pasted image 20230417121247.png]]
problems can occur if they run concurrently

#### 1. Lost Updates
Happens when 2+ transactions
- Access same data item
- Executed concurrently
- Interleaved to incorrect value written to database
![[Pasted image 20230417121422.png]]

#### 2. Temporary Updates
Happens when 2+ transactions
- Access same data item
- Executed consurrently
- Are interleaved
- One transaction fails and must roll back
AKA "Dirty Read"
![[Pasted image 20230417121531.png]]

#### 3. Incorrect Summary
Happens when 2+ transactions
- Access same data item
- Executed concurrently
- Are interleaved
- One transaction is calculating an aggregate summary on attributes while another is updating those attributes
![[Pasted image 20230417121638.png]]

### 2. Schedules
The order of execution of the operations when transactions are executing concurrently in an interleaved fashion
- Schedule S of n transactions $T_1,T_2,...,T_3$ is the ordering of operations in those transactions

Operations from different transactions can be interleaved
- *Operations from each transaction $T_i$ **must** appear in the same order in S as in $T_i$*

#### 1. Writing Schedules
Generally written as 

$S_a : O_i(X); O_i(Y); O_j(X); O_j(Y); ....; O_n(Y);$
Where
- $O_i(X)$ indicates a read or write operation executed by transaction $T_i$ on data item X
- $O_i(Y)$ indicates a read or write operation executed by transaction $T_i$ on data item Y

##### Example
![[Pasted image 20230417122519.png]]
$S_1 : R_1(reserved\_seats\_X); W_1(reserved\_seats\_X); R_2(reserved\_seats\_X); W_2(reserved\_seats\_X); R_1(reserved\_seats\_Y); W_1(reserved\_seats\_Y);$

#### 2. Schedule Conflict
Two operations in a schedule are said to conflict if:
1. They belong to different transactions
2. They access the same item X
3. At least one of the operations is a write(X)

Intuitively, two operations are conflicting if changing their order can result in a different outcome – or cause one of the concurrency issues we have already discussed

##### Examples
Operations $O_i$ and $O_n$ of transactions $T_i$ and $T_n$ respectively on data item Q.

1. $O_i$ = read(Q), $O_n$ = read(Q): don't conflict
2. $O_i$ = read(Q), $O_n$ = write(Q): conflict
3. $O_i$ = write(Q), $O_n$ = read(Q): conflict
4. $O_i$ = write(Q), $O_n$ = write(Q): conflict

Same example as above, red arrows between ones that conflict, green between ones that don't
![[Pasted image 20230417123147.png]]

#### 3. Serial Schedules
Operations of each transaction execute consecutively, no interleaving
![[Pasted image 20230417123234.png]]

- Formally, schedule S is *serial* if, for every transaction T participating in the schedules, all operations of T are executed consecutively
	- Otherwise, nonserial
- In a serial schedule, only one transaction active at a time.
	- Commit/abort of active transmission starts execution of next transaction

##### Correctness
We can assume *every serial schedule is correct*
1. All transactions should be independent (*I*solation from ACID)
2. Each transaction is assumed to be correct if executed on its own (**C**onsistency preservation)
3. => Ordering of transactions in serial schedule does not matter (once every transaction is executed from beginning to end)

##### Problems with Serial Schedules
1. Limit concurrency
2. If a transaction is waiting for an operation to complete, not possible to switch processing
3. If transaction T is very long, all other transactions must wait for T to complete its operations before they can begin

=> serial schedules considered unacceptable in practice.


#### 4. Serializability
- If other nonserial schedules are *equivalent* to a serial schedule, they are allowed (called serializable)
- How to measure equivalence?
	1. Result Equivalence
	2. Conflict Equivalence
- Saying a schedule is serializable is the same as saying it is correct
	- All serial schedules are correct
	- This is equivalent to a serial schedule
	- => this is also correct
- Give benefit of concurrent execution without giving up correctness

##### Result Equivalence
- Simplest notion of equivalence
- Two schedules are "result equivalent" if they produce the same final state of the DB
- BUT 2 schedules could coincidentally produce the same result...
![[Pasted image 20230417124720.png]]

##### Conflict Equivalence
- Two schedules are conflict equivalent if the order of any 2 conflicting operations is the same in both schedules
- Reminder, in conflict if
	1. Belong to different transactions
	2. Access same item X
	3. At least one is write(X)

###### Non-conflict equivalent
- If 2 conflicting operation applied in different orders in *two schedules*, effect can be different on DB.

- Eg: if read and write occur in order
	- R1(X), W2(X) in schedule S1
	- W2(X), R1(X) in schedule S2
- Value read by R1(X) may be different in 2 schedules as it may have been updated by the write

- Eg: if two write operations occur in order
	- W1(X), W2(X) in schedule S1
	- W2(X), W1(X) in schedule S2
- Next R(X) value in the schedules will read potentially different values
- If these are the last 2 operations in schedule, final value of X in DB will be different


###### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20230417130428.png]]
$S_a: R_1(X);W_1(X);R_1(Y);W_1(Y);R_2(X);W_2(X);$
**Conflicts:**
1. $R_1(X);W_2(X);$
2. $W_1(X);R_2(X);$
3. $W_1(X);W_2(X);$

![[Pasted image 20230417130444.png]]
$S_b: R_1(X); W_1(X); R_2(X); W_2(X); R_1(Y); W_1(Y);$
**Conflicts:**
1. $R_1(X);W_2(X);$
2. $W_1(X);R_2(X);$
3. $W_1(X);W_2(X);$

Conflict Equivalent!

###### Example 2
![[Pasted image 20230417131028.png]]

##### Determining Serializability
Swap operations to serial, if swapping conflicting ones, it is not serialisable.

###### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20230417131225.png]]
$S_a: r_1(X); r_1(Y); r_2(X); r_2(Y); w_2(Y); w_1(X);$

**Conflicting operations:**
1. $r_1(Y); w_2(Y);$
2. $r_2(X); w_1(X);$
![[Pasted image 20230417131522.png]]

## 3. Concurrency Control Protocols
- CCP are set of protocols in DBMS which
	1. Must be followed by every transaction
	2. Enforced by concurrency control subsystem
	3. Ensure serializability of all transactions' schedules

### 1. Optimistic Protocols
Based on validation of transaction after it executes its operations

### 2. Locking
Lock is a variable associated with a data item
- Describes status of data item w.r.t. operations that can be applied to it
- Data items may be at a variety of granularities (DB, table, tuple, attribute, etc)
Synchronize access by concurrent transactions

#### 1. Types of Lock
##### 1. Binary Lock
- Only has 2 states
	- Locked/unlocked
- Two operations used
	- lock_item/unlock_item
- Each transactipn locks the item before using it, unlocks when finished
- Transaction wants to access data item
	1. Requests to lock item
	2. If item unlocked, transaction locks it and can use it
	3. If item locked, transaction must wait til unlocked.

- Rarely used, too restrictive
	- at most 1 transaction can access item at a time
	- Several transactions should be allowed to access concurrently if they're just reading

##### 2. Read/Write Lock
- If multiple transactions want to read an item, they can access concurrently
	- Read is not conflicting
- If a transaction is writing, must have exclusive access
- Read/write lock implements this (multiple-mode lock)

- Locking operations:
	- read_lock
	- write_lock
	- unlock
- *read-locked* item aka *share-locked* as other transactions are allowed to read
- *write-locked* item aka *exclusive-locked* as 1 transaction has access to it

###### Rules
Must be enforced
1. Transaction *T* must issue operation read_lock(X)/write_lock(X) before any read_item(X) operation is performed in T
2. Transaction T must issue operation write_lock(X) before any write_item(X) operation is performed in T
3. A transaction T must issue the operation unlock(X) after all read_item(X) and write_item(X) operations are completed in T
4. A transaction T will not issue an unlock(X) operation unless it already holds a read lock or a write lock on item X

###### Lock Conversion
Some DBMS allow conversion of a lock from one stage to another
- Transaction T can issue a read_lock(X) and then later upgrade the lock by issuing a write_lock(X)
	- If T is the only transaction holding a read_lock on X when it issues the write_lock(X) operation
	- Otherwise, transaction must wait
- Also possible to downgrade by issuing write_lock and *then* read_lock

###### Example
![[Pasted image 20230417133812.png]]

#### Two phase locking
Additional protocol
- Positioning of locking and unlocking in eveyr transaction
- Guarantees serializability

A transaction follows two-phase locking if all lock operations precede the first unlock operation in that transaction.

##### Phases
1. Expanding phase - new locks on items can be acquired but none can be released
2. Shrinking phase - existing locks can be released but no new locks can be acquired

If lock conversion is allowed
1. Upgrading of locks in expanding phase
2. Downgrading of locks in shrinking phase

![[Pasted image 20230417134105.png]]

##### Serialisability
- If every transaction in a schedule follows the 2-phase locking protocol, guaranteed to be serializable
- Removes need to test a schedule for serializability
- (at a cost)

##### Limitations
- Limits concurrency in a schedule
![[Pasted image 20230417134607.png]]

#### 3. Problems with Locking - Deadlock
Occurs when
1. Each transaction $T_i$ in a set of 2+ transactions is waiting for some item locked by another transaction in the set
2. => each transaction in the set is waiting for one of the other transactions in the set to release the lock
3. Because the other transaction is also waiting, it will never release the lock
![[Pasted image 20230417134820.png]]

##### Prevention Protocols
Decide what to do with a transaction in a possible deadlock situation:
- Blocked and made to wait?
- Aborted?
- Preempt another transaction and cause it to abort?

Typically use a transaction timestamp - unique id assigned to each transaction
- based on order transaction starts
- => if T1 starts before T2, then TS(T1) < TS(T2)

###### 1. No Waiting
- If a transaction is unable to obtain a lock, it immediately aborts
- Restarts after a certain time delay - not checking whether a deadlock will occur
- No deadlock ever happens, but causes transactions to abort + restart needlessly
![[Pasted image 20230417135206.png]]
T1 aborts as it can't get a lock on X, and T2 never gets a block

###### 2. Wait-die
Ta tries to lock X, not able to because locked by Tb

Wait-die
- If Ta is older than Tb, then Ta is allowed to wait
- Otherwise, abort Ta and restart it later *with the same timestamp*

![[Pasted image 20230417135421.png]]
T1 is older than T2, so allowed to wait after unable to obtain lock on X.
T2 is younger than T1, so aborted after unable to get lock on Y

Cause some transactions to be needlessly aborted and restarted

###### 3. Wound-wait
Ta tries to lock X, not able to because locked by Tb

Wound-wait:
- If Ta older than Tb, then abort Tb, restart it later *with the same timestamp*
- Otherwise, Ta waits
- (Ta either wounds Tb or waits)
![[Pasted image 20230417135421.png]]
T1 is older than T2, so T2 is aborted after T1 unable to get lock on X

Cause some transactions to be needlessly aborted and restarted

###### 4. Cautious Waiting
Ta tries to lock X, not able to because locked by Tb

Cautious waiting:
- If Tb is not blocked, then Ta is blocked and allowed to wait
- Otherwise, abort Ta
![[Pasted image 20230417135801.png]]
T1 unable to get lock on X, T2 holds lock on X and is not blocked, so T1 is blocked.
T2 unable to get lock on Y, T1 holds lock on Y and *is* blocked, so T2 is aborted

##### Deadlock Detection
Check if a state of deadlock actually exists
- Attractive if there is little interference
- If transactions are long, best to use prevention instead.


Construct and maintain a wait-for graph
1. One node is created in the wait-for graph for each transaction currently executing
2. Whenever a transaction Ta is waiting to lock an item X currently locked buy Tb, directed edge Ta->Tb is created in graph
3. When Tb releases, directed edge is dropped
Deadlock iff wait-for graph has a loop

###### Dealing with deadlock
- Resolve by aborting and rolling back some transaction
- Choosing which transaction? *victim selection*
	- Avoid selecting long running/many updating transactions
	- Select young ones!

#### 4. Problems with Locking - Starvation
- When a transaction cannot proceed for an indefinite period of time while other transactions in the system continue normally
- Why?
	- If waiting scheme for locked items gives priority to some
	- Victim selection (if it always chooses the same)

##### Starvation Solutions
1. First come first served queue
Transactions lock an item in the order originally requested

2. Waiting list 
Allows some transactions to have priority over others, but increases priority the longer a transaction waits

3. Victim priority
Assigns higher priority to transactions that have been aborted multiple times

### 3. Timestamps
- Timestamp values assigned to transactions in the order they are submitted  (transaction start time)
- Exist concurrency control techniques based just on timestamp ordering, not using locking -> no deadlocks

#### Timestamp Ordering
- For each data item accessed by conflicting operations in the schedule, *the order in which the item is accessed must not biolate the timestamp ordering*
- Produces serialisable schedules!

#### In DBMS
DBMS keeps 2 timestamp values for each data item
- read_TS(X)
	- Equal to timestamp of youngest (most recently started) transaction that has successfully read item X
- write_TS(X)
	- Equal to timestamp of youngest (most recently started) transaction that has successfully written item X

##### write_item(X)
When transaction T issues write_item(X) operation, following is checked:
1. If read_TS(X) > TS(T) or write_TS(X) > TS(T)
	- Abort and rollback T, reject operation
	- Some younger transaction (more recent, therefore larger timestamp) has already read/written X
	- BEFORE T was able to
	- This violates timestamp ordering
2. If read_TS(X) <= TS(T) and write_TS(X) <= TS(T)
	- Execute the write_item(X) operation of T
	- Set write_TS(X) to TS(T)
![[Pasted image 20230417153921.png]]


##### read_item(X)
When transaction T issues read_item(X) operation, following is checked:
1. If write_TS(X) > TS(T)
	- Abort and rollback T, reject operation
	- Some younger transaction (more recent, therefore larger timestamp) has already written X
	- BEFORE T was able to
	- This violates timestamp ordering
2.  If write_TS(X) <= TS(T) and write_TS(X) <= TS(T)
	- Execute the read_item(X) operation of T
	- Set read_TS(X) to the larger of
		- TS(T)
		- current read_TS(X)
