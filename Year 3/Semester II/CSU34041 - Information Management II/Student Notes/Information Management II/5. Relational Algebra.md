## Relational Algebra
**Relational algebra:** is the basic set of operations to manipulate the Relational Database

- Provides a **formal foundation** for relational model operations
- Is used as a basis for implementing and optimizing **queries**
- Incorporating into SQL for RDBMS

### Algebra?
Mathematical system consisting of operators and operands.

### Relational Algebra

#### Operators 
![[Pasted image 20230227125446.png]]
Designed to do the most common things with relations in a database

#### Operands
![[Pasted image 20230227125751.png]]
Relational algebra is an algebra whose operands are either
1. Relations 
2. Variables that represent relations

Reusult is an algebra that can be used as a query language for relations


### Operations
#### Set Operations
From mathematical theory
- Union, intersection, etc
- Applicable as each relation is defined to be the **set** of tuples in the relational model

#### Relational Database Operations
- Designed specifically for relational databases
- Unary Operations
	- Operate on a single **relation**
	- SELECT and PROJECT
- Binary operations
	- A JOIN is used to combine related tuples across 2 relations using a *join condition*


#### Selection in Relational Algebra
Identify the subset of tuples from a relation that satisfy a selection condition
1. Acts as a filter on a relation
2. Horizontal partition of a relation

Unary! Applied to a single relation, applied to each tuple in turn.
Number of tuples returned for a Select operation is always $\leq$ number of tuples in R
![[Pasted image 20230227132154.png]]


##### Formal Notation
$$\sigma_{(select \ condition)}(R)$$
###### Eg:
Identifying all employees in dept 4
![[Pasted image 20230227130642.png]]
$$\sigma_{(Dno=4)(EMPLOYEE)}$$

##### Result
A new relation
- Made up of tuples satisfying the selection condition
- New relation has same attributes as relation R on which selection was performed
- Is essentially a horizontal partition
![[Pasted image 20230227130852.png]]

##### Selection condition
Made up of clauses
`<attribute name> <comparison op> <constant value>`

###### Attribute name
Name of an attribute (column) of R

###### Comparison op
Operator like =, <, $\leq$, etc. For Ordered Domains. Just = for unordered Domains

###### Constant value
A constant value from the attribute domain

###### Joining
Selection conditions can be joined by boolean operators and, or, & not

###### Example
Select all employees who either work in department 4 and make over €25,000 a year or work in department 5 and make over €30,000 a year

$\sigma_{((Dno=4 \  AND \ Salary>25000) \ OR\  (Dno=5 \  AND \ Salary>30000))}(EMPLOYEE)$

Another attribute can also be used

##### Degree
- Number of attributes in a relation
- Degree of select operator is same as degree of relation R
- Eg, degree of $\sigma_{(Dno=4)(EMPLOYEE)}$ is 9

##### Selectivity
- Selectivity is the fraction of tuples in a relation selected by a condition
- What is selectivity of $\sigma_{(Dno=4)(EMPLOYEE)}$? $\frac{3}{8}$
![[Pasted image 20230227130642.png]]

##### Order of operations
- It is commutative
These are equivalent
![[Pasted image 20230227132457.png]]

###### Cascade/Sequence in single operation
![[Pasted image 20230227132523.png]]

##### Selection in SQL
$\sigma_{(Dno=4 \  AND \ Salary>25000)}(EMPLOYEE)$
$\rightarrow$ `SELECT * from EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno=4 AND Salary>25000;` 

#### Projection in Relational Algebra
- Selects specific attributes from the table, discarding others
- **Vertical** partition

##### Formal Notation
$\pi_{attribute \ list}(R)$
 Eg: list all employees first and last names and their salary
 $\pi_{Fname,Lname,Salary}(EMPLOYEE)$

##### Degree
Relation resulting from Project has number of attributes specified in attribute list
- **Degree** of resulting relation is equal to number of attributes in list

###### Example
![[Pasted image 20230227133027.png]]
Degree of this is 3

##### Duplicate Elimination 
Project must return a valid relation, but what if there are duplicates in it (removing unique elements)? Operation removes/merges duplicate tuples, only returning distinct tuples

##### Projection in SQL
Also uses SELECT!
$\pi_{Fname,Lname,Salary}(EMPLOYEE)$
$\rightarrow$ `SELECT FName,LName,Salary from EMPLOYEE`

###### Duplicate Elimination
This SQL statement does not automatically implement duplicate elimination, so we need to make it do that:
`SELECT DISTINCT FName,LName,Salary from EMPLOYEE`

#### Combining Selection and Projection
![[Pasted image 20230227135908.png]]


$$\pi_{Lname,Fname,Salary}(\sigma_{((Dno=4 \  AND \ Salary>25000) \ OR\  (Dno=5 \  AND \ Salary>30000))}(EMPLOYEE))$$

##### Intermediate Relations -  if you don't want to nest
All intermediate tables must be named!
![[Pasted image 20230227140334.png]]

##### Into SQL
```SQL
SELECT Fname,Lname,Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dno=4
AND Salary>25000;
```

#### Set Operators
- Standard mathematical operations used to merge elements of 2 sets
	- Union
	- Intersection
	- Set Difference
- Binary Operations (2 sets!)

To use these operations, two relations must be union compatible
- Same number of attributes
- Each corresponding pair of attributes ha the same domain
- **Formally:** Two relations $R(A_1,A_2,...,A_n)$ and $S(B_1,B_2,...,B_n)$ are said to be union compatible if
	- They have the same degree n
	- dom($A_i$) = dom($B_i$) for $1\leq i \leq n$ where the domain is the permitted range of values for an attribute of an entity

##### Union and Intersection
Can both be treated as *n-ary* operations
- Applicable to any number of relations
- (as they're associative)
![[Pasted image 20230301124412.png]]

###### Union
Denoted by ![[Pasted image 20230301123837.png]]$R\lceil S$ 

Result is a new relation containing all tuples in either or both R and S
- Duplicates discarded
- It is commutative

###### Intersection
Denoted by ![[Pasted image 20230301124150.png]]$RÇS$

Result is a new relation which contains all tuples in both R and S
- It is commutative

##### Difference
Denoted by 
![[Pasted image 20230301124434.png]]
$R-S$

Result of set difference or minus operation is a new relation with all tuples which are in R, but not S
- Not commutative

##### Join
Denoted by ![[Pasted image 20230301125033.png]]$R\bowtie_{(join \ condition)}S$

Combine related tuples from two relations into a single tuple
- Allows for processing of relationships between relations
- Uses Foreign Keys and Referential Integrity constraints

###### Details
Consider two relations $R(A_1,A_2,...,A_n)$ and $S(B_1,B_2,...,B_n)$
The result of $R\bowtie_{(join \ condition)}S$ is a new relation Q with
1. n+m attributes
2. $Q(A_1,A_2,...,A_n,B_1,B_2,...,B_m)$
3. A tuple for each combination of tuples (one from R and one from S) that satisfy the join condition

###### Join Condition
- Specified on attributes from both relations 
- Evaluated for **every combination** of tuples 
- Each tuple combination where the join condition is TRUE is included in the result relation as a single combined tuple

###### Example
Want to return the name of the manager of each department
![[Pasted image 20230301135909.png]]
$DEPARTMENT\bowtie _{Mgr\_ssn=Ssn}EMPLOYEE$ 

Returns
![[Pasted image 20230301140031.png]]

**Another eg with Foreign key/Primary key identified**
![[Pasted image 20230301140250.png]]

###### In SQL
```sql
SELECT * -- selects all attributes/columns, can select specific ones if wanted
FROM Relation1, Relation2
WHERE join-condition;
```

**Eg:**
```sql
SELECT employee.name, job, department.name 
FROM employee, department 
WHERE employee.deptno = department.deptno;
```
![[Pasted image 20230301140619.png]]
##### Set operations Example
![[Pasted image 20230301124609.png]]
**Are these union compatible?** Same degree? yes, same domain for each attribute? yes, so yes
###### Union
![[Pasted image 20230301124712.png]]

###### Difference
![[Pasted image 20230301124756.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230301124806.png]]

###### Intersection
![[Pasted image 20230301124824.png]]

##### In SQL
1. Union $\rightarrow$ `UNION`
2. Intersection $\rightarrow$ `INTERSECT`
3. Set difference $\rightarrow$ `EXCEPT`

Also, multi-set operators, do not eliminate duplicates
- `UNION ALL`
- `INTERSECT ALL`
- `EXCEPT ALL`
