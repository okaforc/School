## DBMS Classification
- Via which conceptual data model is used 
- Affects all other components in the system (esp external schema and associated DML)
- Eg:
	1. Hierarchical
	2. Network
	3. Relational
	4. Object-oriented + Object-Relational
	5. Graph, Columnar, In memory, NoSQL

## Generally Hierarchical Data Models
### 1. Hierarchical Database
- Oldest database model - common in mainframe computing
- Hierarchical, parent and child nodes
![[Pasted image 20230202125858.png]]

### 2. Network Database
- Also hierarchical
- Members and owners
	- Member can have >1 owner

### 3. Object-Oriented Database
- Models Data Storage similarly to applications
	- Persistent storage of program objects (ie classes)
	- Objects get to survive past the end of program execution
- Impedence mismatch problem
	- If the data structures in the DBMS are incompatible with the programming languages Data Structures

### 4. Graph Database
- Graph structure
	- Nodes
	- Edges
	- Properties
- Relationships are as important as the elements

## Non-Hierarchical Data Models
### 5. Relational Database
- More flexible than hierarchical models
- Uses
	- Relations (Tables)
	- Tuples (Rows)
	- Attributes (Columns)

#### Relational Model
- Theoretical basis on set theory and first order predicate logic
- Database represented as **collection of mathematical relations**
	- Informally, tables of values

##### Elements
1. Table/Relation
	- Basic storage structure of relational db
	- Tables are 2D
2. Row/Tuple
	- Collection of related values
	- Represents a fact corresponding to an entity or relationship
3. Column/Attribute
	- Contains values of the same data type

![[Pasted image 20230202131022.png]]

##### Domain
**Domain of possible values:** represents the data type describing the values that can appear in a column
Eg:
- mobile_phone_number: The set of 10 digit phone numbers valid in Ireland
- – PPS_number: 9 characters in length. 7 numeric characters in positions 1 to 7, followed by 1 alphabetic check character in position 8, and either a space or the letter “W” in position 9

#### Formal Definitions

##### Relational Schema
A relational schema $R$ denoted by $R(A_1,A_2,...,A_n)$ is made up of
1. **Relation** name $R$
2. List of **attributes** $A_1...A_n$
3. Each **attribute** $A_i$ is the name of the role played by **domain** $D_i$ in **relation** R
	- (Attribute is the name of the column, ie, mobile_phone_number, whose domain is The set of 10 digit phone numbers valid in Ireland)
	- $D_i$ is the domain of $A_i$ and is denoted by $dom(A_i)$
4. The **degree** of schema, = number of **attributes** (n)

###### Example
![[Pasted image 20230202131755.png]]
**Relation:**$STUDENT(Name, Ssn, Home\_phone, Address, Office\_phone, Age, Gpa)$
**Degree** of relation STUDENT: 7

##### Relation state
A **relation state** r of a relational schema $R(A_1, A_2, …, A_n)$, also denoted $r(R)$ is:
1. **Set of tuples**: $r= \langle t_1, t_2, ..., t_m \rangle$ 
2. Each **tuple** t is an ordered list of n values $t= \langle v_1, v_2, ..., v_n \rangle$
	- (Row)
	- Where each value $v_i, 1 \leq i \leq n$ is an element of $dom(A_i)$
4. The $i^{th}$ value of tuple $t_n$, corresponding to attribute $A^i$ is referred to as $t_n[A_i]$ or  $t_n[i]$
	- (element)

#### Characteristics of Relations
1. Ordering of tuples (rows)
	- Relation is a **set** of tuples
	- So tuples/rows have no order
2. Ordering of values in tuples
	- Each tuple is an ordered list of n values
	- (order can change, but attributes and values must change together)
3. Values
	1. Each value is *atomic*
		- Not composite or multivalued (in flat at least)
	2. For multivalued attributes: (eg college degree) represent by seperate relations
	3. For composite attributes: (eg address) represent by a single component
4. NULL values
	- Represent values of attribute which are *unknown* or don't apply to a tuple (row)
	- Meanings:
		- Value unknown
		- Value exists but is unavailable
		- Attribute doesn't apply to this tuple (value undefined)
	- NULL value defined for each domain with restrictions

#### Primary Key
- Relations usually have *one* attribute whose values *uniquely identify its tuples*:
	- Eg, student_number in relation STUDENT
	- No 2 students have the same student number
- This attribute is called a *primary key*

##### Multiple Keys
- Not all relations have just one attribute for Primary Key
![[Pasted image 20230208104710.png]]
- When several *Candidate Keys* exist
	- Combine them OR
	- Choose 1

#### Relational Model Constraints
- Derived from what database represents
- **Schema based** or **explicit** constraints
	- Can be expressed in the schema of the data model
	- IE using DDL
- **Application based** or **semantic constraints**
	- Cannot be expressed by DDL
	- Must be enforced by the application

Key and Entity constraints are enforced by the DBMS once defined:

##### Keys and Integrity Constraints
Relations and attributes must be named, and are often qualified by relation name, resolving ambiguity:
- PATIENT.name
- DOCTOR.name

##### Entity Integrity Constraint
- May not be *any* duplicate entries in Primary Key attribute
- NULL values not allowed in Primary Key fields
	- Primary Key identifies a tuple
	- NULL means we can't identify it, not allowed

##### Referential Integrity Constraints
- While key and entity constraints are on individual relations, referential are *between* two relations
- Maintains consistency among tuples in 2 relations
- **Informally:** A tuple in one relation that refers to another relation, must refer to an *existing tuple* in that relation
![[Pasted image 20230208105300.png]]

###### Foreign Keys
Formally specifies a Referential Integrity Constraint.
- Consider relation schemas $R_1$,$R_2$
- Set of attributes $FK$ in $R_1$ is a Foreign key of $R_1$ that references $R_2$ if:
	1. Attributes of $FK$ have the *same domains* as the Primary Key attributes $PK$ of $R_2$
		- $FK$ references or refers to $R_2$
		- (Foreign Key of $R_1$ has the same domain as Primary Key of $R_2$)
	2. A value of $FK$ in tuple $t_1$ is either NULL or occurs as a value of $PK$ for some tuple $t_2$
		- Tuple $t_1$ references or refers to tuple $t_2$
		- (Foreign Key value of $R_1$ is either NULL or refers to an actual instance of the Primary Key of $R_2$)

#### Examples of Table Relationships 
![[Pasted image 20230208110240.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230208110254.png]]

##### Specific Example
###### STUDENT 
(**student_number**, student_name, student_address) 

student_number is the primary key

###### COURSE 
(**course_number**, course_title, lecturer) 

course_number is the primary key

###### RESULT 
(**course_number, student_number**, grade)

(fk_)course_number is a Foreign Key of RESULT that references COURSE.
- RESULT.course_number and COURSE.course_number have the same domain
- Each tuple in RESULT must contain a course_number which exists in a tuple in COURSE, or be NULL

(fk_)student_number is a Foreign Key of RESULT that references STUDENT.
- RESULT.course_number and STUDENT.student_number have the same domain
- Each tuple in RESULT must contain a student_number which exists in a tuple in STUDENT, or be NULL
