## Types of Constraints

### Integrity vs Security
#### Integrity
Integrity is concerned with accidental corruption
- integrety constraints

#### Security
Security is concerned with deliberate corruption
- Security policies
- Access control

### Relational Model Constraints
#### Explicit Constraints
expressed within the Relational Schema

#### Semantic Constraints
cannot be expressed within the Relational Schema
- can be expressed in SQL in some cases 
- usually enforced by the application programs

## Integrity Constraints in Detail
DBMS must be able to enforce these constraints

### Key Constraints
- **May not be any duplicate entries** in key attributes
	- Primary keys
	- Candidate keys

Keys are used to uniquely identify a tuple
 - Having a duplicate value in a Key implies that we cannot uniquely identify some tuples

### Entity Integrity
Specifies that there **may not be any NULL values** in the Primary Key attribute
- The Primary Key is used to uniquely identify each tuple in a relation 
- Having NULL in a Primary Key implies that we cannot identify some tuples

### Referential Integrity
(Entity constraints are specified on individual relations)

- **Referential** Integrity constraints are specified between two relations
	- Maintains consistency among tuples in the two relations 
	- *A tuple in one relation that refers to another relation, must refer to an existing tuple in that relation*

A Foreign Key formally specifies a Referential Integrity Constraint between two relations.

#### NULL keys
- By Entity Integrity constraint
	- No part of primary key can be NULL
- Foreign Keys in certain circumstances may be NULL
- When defining an attribute as a Foreign Key 
	- You must also specify whether or not the foreign key is allowed to contain NULLs
- Composite foreign key?
	- if the Foreign Key is allowed to contain NULLs then either all the component attributes should be NULL or none of them NULL (enforce referential integrity)

##### Examples
![[Pasted image 20230329161517.png]]
GP_ID cannot be NULL, it's a primary key
GP *can* be NULL, it's a foreign key!

![[Pasted image 20230329161659.png]]
We should not allow Student_No in result to be NULL, as a result cant exist without a student

## Constraint Violations
### How?
3 basic operations modify state
1. Insert
2. Update
3. Delete

These operations should not violate the integrity constraints specified for the DB – Key, Entity, Referential

### Example
![[Pasted image 20230329162327.png]]
### Insert Constraint Violation
Insert provides a list of attribute values for a new tuple t that is to be added to relation R.
Insert can violate all integrity constraints discussed
1. Key: no duplicate entries in key attr
2. Entity: no NULL values in primary key
3. Referential: eg foreign key formally specifies referential integrity constraint between two relations

#### Examples
Can we insert `<‘Cecilia’, ‘F’, ‘Kolonsky’, NULL, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’, F, 28000, NULL, 4>` into EMPLOYEES?

No, violates **Entity Integrity** constraint as inserting with Ssn NULL

Can we insert `<‘Alicia’, ‘J’, ‘Zelaya’, ‘999887777’, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’, F, 28000, ‘987654321’, 4>` into EMPLOYEES?

No violates **Key constraint** as the Ssn value being inserted is already a key value in a tuple in EMPLOYEE.

`<‘Cecilia’, ‘F’, ‘Kolonsky’, ‘677678989’, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windswept, Katy, TX’, F, 28000, ‘987654321’, 7>`?
Violates referential, no dept 7.

`<‘Cecilia’, ‘F’, ‘Kolonsky’, ‘677678989’, ‘1960-04-05’, ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’, F, 28000, NULL, 4>`
No violation of key, entity or referential

### Delete Constraint violation
To specify a deletion, a condition on the attributes of a relation is created which selects one or more tuples to be deleted 
- The Delete operation can only violate the Referential Integrity constraint

#### Examples
Can we delete Any tuples in WORKS_ON with Essn = ‘999887777’ and Pno = 10?
Yes, does not violate any referential integrity constraints.

Any tuples in EMPLOYEE with Ssn = ‘999887777’?
No, violates referential integrity constraints as works_on has this value

Any tuples in EMPLOYEE with Ssn = ‘333445555’
No, loads have this


#### Cascading Deletes
- An option to address Delete operations which violate Referential Integrity is to cascade, or propagate, the deletion 
- For instance, in example 2: 
	- Delete any tuples in EMPLOYEE with Ssn = ‘999887777’ 
- The DBMS could automatically delete the offending tuples from WORKS_ON 
	- in addition to the original tuple in EMPLOYEE 
	- This must be implemented carefully, as it can lead to unintentional loss of data

### Update Constraint Violation
- An Update operation is used to change the values of one or more attributes of a relation 
- To specify an update, a condition on the attributes of a relation is created which selects one or more tuples to be modified 
- Updates can violate all the integrity constraints that we have discussed 

#### Examples?
![[Pasted image 20230329163437.png]]
Can do this! not primary key, no other relations refer to this.

![[Pasted image 20230329163515.png]]
Can do this! Not primary key, refers to a valid dept

![[Pasted image 20230329163549.png]]
Can't do this, violates referential integrity as 7 is not a valid department number


![[Pasted image 20230329163652.png]]
No! violates key constraint, that already exists, also violates referential integrity

#### Cascading Updates
As with Delete, an option to address Update operations which violate Referential Integrity is to cascade, or propagate, the update 
For instance: 
- Update the Ssn of any EMPLOYEE tuples with Ssn = ‘333445555’ to ‘123123123’ 
- The DBMS could automatically update the relations which have a Foreign Key to Ssn – WORKS_ON, DEPARTMENT, DEPENDENT and EMPLOYEE itself

### Alternatives to Cascading
1. Rejection of the update or delete as long as foreign key references exist 
2. Update of the corresponding foreign key to NULL 
3. Update of the corresponding foreign key to some default value

## Constraints in SQL
- Constraints specified as part of relation, or table, definition are called *table constraints*
- They are specified on each table individually 
- They are typically specified during table creation in the CREATE TABLE statement
	- can be added later using ALTER TABLE 
	- Constraints that affect more than one table are called *Assertions*

### Primary Key Constraints
The PRIMARY KEY constraint specifies the attribute(s) that forms the Primary Key
- For a single attribute, the constraint can directly follow the attribute specification
	- `Dnumber INT PRIMARY KEY`
- Composite keys can be specified at the end of the CREATE TABLE statement
	- `PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber, Dlocation)`

### UNIQUE
Often >1 candidate key

Secondary keys specified using UNIQUE constraint
- For a single attribute, the constraint can directly follow the attribute specification
	- *Engine_num INT UNIQUE* 
- Composite secondary keys can be specified at the end of the CREATE TABLE statement 
	- UNIQUE (Licence_Yr, Licence_Mth, Licence_Day)

### NOT NULL
By default SQL allows NULLs as attribute values 
- a NOT NULL constraint may be specified if NULLs are not permitted for a specific attribute 
- this is always the case for any attribute that forms part of the Primary Key

### Referential Integrity
Specified using FOREIGN KEY clause
- At end of CREATE TABLE
	- `FOREIGN KEY (Dno) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT(Dnumber)`
- Can be composite
	- `FOREIGN KEY (artist, album) REFERENCES ALBUM(artist, name)

#### Violations
- Can be violated on update, insert, or delete
- Default SQL rejects operation
- Can specify alternate action!
	1. SET NULL
	2. CASCADE
	3. SET DEFAULT
- Must qualify...
	1. ON DELETE
	2. ON UPDATE

![[Pasted image 20230329164746.png]]




### Complex Constraints
Can be specified using CHECK, ASSERTION, TRIGGER

#### CHECK
- Restrict the values that can be entered for an attribute 
- Each CHECK is specified on one or more attributes from a single table 
- The CHECK is performed for every tuple that is inserted or modified
- Specified within CREATE TABLE
- On individual attribute:
	- `Dnumber INT NOT NULL CHECK (Dnumber > 0 AND Dnumber < 21)`
- On multiple attributes from the same table:
	- `CHECK (Dept_create_date <= Mgr_start_date)`

#### Naming constraints
You can name your constraints (must be unique names)
![[Pasted image 20230329165944.png]]

#### Assertions
- A stand alone constraint in a schema
	- specify restriction affecting more than 1 table
- Table constraints (CHECK) are only evaluated IFF table to which it is attached has *some* data
- Assertions are required to be true regardless of empty

##### Syntax
General form:
```sql
CREATE ASSERTION <assertion-name>
CHECK (<search-condition>)
```
- Associated with relations in question
- evaluated before operations can be performed on those relations
- Violated if false and operation not allowed
- Define valid states of DB
- Stored as rows in ASSERTIONS table (part of system catalog)

##### Evaluation of Assertions
- Checked at the end of end SQL statement
	- Transaction can be >1 SQL statement
	- Evaluation can be deferred, but only til end of transaction
- If an assertion fails DBMS returns an error message, SQL statement rejected

##### Example
![[Pasted image 20230329170440.png]]
```sql
CREATE ASSERTION max_inventory 
CHECK((SELECT_SUM(Cost_Price) FROM MOVIE) + (SELECT_SUM(Cost_Price) FROM MUSIC) < 500000);
```

#### Triggers
- Event-Condition-Action rules
	- Allow constraints to be checked on specified events, and resulting actions to be invoked
- Only tested when certain events occur (eg: insert, update, etc)
- When triggered
	1. Specified condition is tested
	2. If condition does not hold, no further action is taken
	3. If condition is satisfied, defined actions associated with trigger are performed by DBMS

##### Syntax
General form:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER <trigger name>
(AFTER|BEFORE) <triggering events> ON
<table name> [FOR EACH ROW]
[WHEN <condition>]
<trigger actions>;
```

Form of `<trigger event>`
```sql
INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE 
[ OF <column name>, {, <column name>}]
```


##### Examples
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER Total_Salary
AFTER DELETE ON EMPLOYEE
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN(:Old.Dno IS NOT NULL)
	UPDATE DEPARTMENT
	SET Total_salary = Total_salary-:OLD.Salary
	WHERE Dno = :OLD.Dno;
```

#### Assertions vs Triggers
**Assertions**
- Do not modify data
- Check certain conditions

**Triggers**
- More powerful
- Can check conditions  AND  modify data
- Linked to specific tables and events

- All assertions *can* be implemented as triggers
- Not all triggers can be implemented as assertions

*Oracle does not have assertions*
