This project separates the data into induvidual classes and stores them inside each other.

The hierarchy is:
			             world
	   				v
     		             arraylist:countries
		             v	               	 v
	 arraylist:states/counties          string:name	
			|
			| -> string:name
			|
			v
		arraylist:area
			|
			| -> string:name
			| -> int:geoid
			v
            hashmap:cases, dates

NOTE: this program only really works for smaller datasets due to the number of nested for loops it used. If anyone can optimise it, that would be useful.
