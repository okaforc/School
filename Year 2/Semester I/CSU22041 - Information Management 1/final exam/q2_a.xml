    A valid XML document has a well-structured DTD that includes elements, attributes, entities, and cardinalities. 
    This may or may not be included in the file itself. The XML should have exactly one root element, showing at least one element. 
    Any non-empty tag must have a closing tag, and for any element, its given attribute (if it has one associated with it) must be quoted.
