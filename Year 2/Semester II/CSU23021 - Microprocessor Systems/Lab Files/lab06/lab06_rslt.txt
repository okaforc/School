Sequential System (single-core)
Time taken for Single-Precision (Float) Floating-Point: 0.978260 seconds
Time taken for Double-Precision (Double) Floating-Point: 0.928624 seconds
Full Time: 1.906902 seconds

Parallel System (dual-core)
Time taken for Single-Precision (Float) Floating-Point: 1.026726 seconds
Time taken for Double-Precision (Double) Floating-Point: 0.976938 seconds
Full Time: 1.036875 seconds

Notes: When using dual-core, the time for the Wallis calculations is about 0.05 seconds slower than single-core, and in both cases, there is an approximately 0.05 second gap between float and double calculations. This is likely due to the order in which the calculations are performed.
