- [ ] i
    - [x] a
        - [x] best c value
            - [x] 5, as it minimises f1 score at its value, which i prioritise over standard deviation. c = 10 has the lowest deviation, and the lower the c value, the better, as it minimises over-fitting.
        - [x] best q value
            - [x] 3, as both the max f1 score (c = 5) and minimum std dev (c = 10) are at q = 3.
    - [x] b
        - [x] best k value
            - [x] 4, as the scores for k > 4 are all close enough, and are therefore minimised by k = 4, which also boasts the lowest standard deviation. if k is too large, there exists the risk of under-fitting the data.

    - [ ] b
        - [ ] best k value
            - [ ] 5, as it is close enough to k = 7, and minimises the k value. for whatever reason, odd values of k are more accurate than even values, so k=6 is also not considered for that reason.
