The goal of computer graphics is to manipulate points and vectors.

Geometric operations:
- Scale
- Rotate
- Translate
- Perspective projection
are defined using **matrix transformations**.

Optical effects:
- Reflect
- Refract
are defined using **vector algebra**.

## Vector Quantities
Vector quantities are denoted using **v** or $\vec{v}$. 

Each vector is defined with respect to a set of **basis vectors**, which define a coordinate system. That is, **basis vectors** are vectors that, when combined, can create every vector in a vector system other than each other.

## Vectors and Points
Vectors and points are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a difference between the two.

### Vectors
**Vectors** represent *directions*. They require a set of **basis vectors** to represent the direction they're pointing in.

Two vectors $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$ are **equivalent** if they have the same length and direction. Their positions are not factored into equivalency.

### Points
**Points** represent *positions*. They require an **origin** and a **vector space** to position themselves in.
