# Xelda
https://www.tcd.ie/scss/courses/undergraduate/internships-for-students/current-opportunities/xelda/

## Their Description
### About Us

Xelda is an ambitious FinTech start-up founded by Irish sisters and ex-Goldman Sachs alumni, India and Portia. We are backed by Sequoia Capital and the founders of the Irish unicorn Flipdish.

Our mission is to humanize and automate payments and business management for SMBs. We’re creating a platform that is accessible, efficient and tailored to each business owner.

Many SMBs accept several types of payments - from cash, to card to direct debit. Xelda simplifies payments from 3 platforms to 1. Xelda gives SMBs the power to accept multiple and low cost payment methods from a single device. We make it easier and safer to store and track payments from many revenue streams. We eliminate the hassle of choosing, purchasing and setting up a machine. Xelda gives SMBs their time back by reducing admin. Users have immediate and real time oversight of their businesses.

But Xelda is more than an app that reduces payment and business admin. Xelda will educate SMBs on how to manage their business. Xelda will boost the liquidity of the business. Xelda will empower SMBs to nurture client relationships. Xelda will equip them with unique local market insights to propel their businesses forward. Xelda doesn’t just give back time, she helps shape your future.

For Europe's 23M SMBs, Xelda's not just an app, she's a companion.

### The Team

You will have the opportunity to be a key member of a world class team.

**Our CEO and Co-Founder - India Healy O'Connor**  
India has always believed in working hard and pushing oneself to achieve great things. In school and university, she combined hard work and ambition to achieve first place in her class and graduation year. This drive and desire to learn led her to the dynamic sales and trading floor of Goldman Sachs. There she learned the art of problem solving, managing high pressure situations and developing client relationships. Combining her experience and knowledge of finance and economics she took on the challenge of building Xelda. When India is not working on Xelda, she is running, deep in a good book or chilling with her two french bulldogs - Mabel and Daphne.

**Our COO and Co-Founder - Portia Healy O'Connor**  
As a child, Portia always had brilliant ideas and was frustrated whenever she saw others turn them into a reality. So, when the idea for Xelda came along, she knew this was her time to make the idea a reality. Upon achieving top marks in computer science, statistics and business in Trinity College Dublin, she moved to London where she worked on the high intensity and challenging SWAPS trading team in Goldman Sachs. There, she built complex trading models to help her team better understand the trends of the market. Problem-solving is part of Portia's DNA and so she used these skills to build Xelda's MVP. To relax, Portia loves playing tennis, listening to music and playing with Mabel (sorry Daphne!).

**Our Investors**  
A market research call with the founders of Irish unicorn, Flipdish, turned into an investment offer. Conor and James believed in the Xelda vision. A few months later, we received a call that is every founder's dream. Xelda was invited to join the inaugural Arc. Arc is a Sequoia run program that helps the daring build great companies. It is amazing to have the backing of a world leading VC who has helped to build some of the greatest companies in the world like Airbnb and Klarna. By joining Xelda, you are joining a company backed by dynamic, knowledgeable and innovative investors.

Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in systems design and testing, and have opportunities to present your work to your team and the wider org. Each intern has a dedicated intern manager, and every project is part of the team’s roadmap and will directly help Stripe’s mission.

### What you’ll do

Every internship at Stripe centers around a real, legitimate project that our customers urgently need, touching many parts of our operations and stack. We will support you in shipping it. Yes, you will actually ship it.
