## Event Loop

The Event Loop is central to the JavaScript runtime model. It is responsible for 
- executing the code, 
- collecting and processing events, and 
- executing queued sub-tasks. 
It is different from other C-like languages like Java.

### Execution Context
#### Stack
The stack contains function calls that form a single-threaded stack of frames that stores local variables and references to functions and objects.

#### Heap
The heap contains objects, function definitions, and arrays. It get removed by the Garbage Collector.

#### Queue
The queue is a list of messages to be processed. Each message has an associated function that gets called to handle the message.

#### Browser or Web APIs
These expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment. They aren't part of the JavaScript Engine, but they *are* part of the JavaScript Runtime Environment and the browser. They enter the Event Table and wait for an event using **asynchronous methods**.

#### Event Loop
The Event loop runs when the stack is empty. The runtime starts handling the messages on the queue and the corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. It then creates a new stack frame for that function's use.

```js
function printStatement() { 
	console.log("Will the function delayed for 0 milliseconds be first") 
}

setTimeout(printStatement, 0)

console.log("Or, will I be executed first?")
/////////////////////////////////////////////
>> Or, will I be executed first?
>> Will the function delayed for 0 milliseconds be first
```

#### Features
Each message is process completely before any other message is processed. There is no pre-emption; that is, nothing skips ahead of any other message. This allows for shorter handler functions. Events need "listeners" to enter the queue.

Listeners can be added to Events using `addEventListener(Event, Handler)`. The Event can be a click or mouseover, or double-click, etc, and `Handler` is a handler function.

```html
<button>Change color</button> 
<script> 
	const btn = document.querySelector('button'); 
	function random(number) { 
		return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number+1)); 
	} 
	// 'click' is the event to look for, and the inline function is the handler
	btn.addEventListener('click', () => { 
		const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)}, ${random(255)}, ${random(255)})`; 
		document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol; 
	}); 
</script>
```

## True Parallelism in JavaScript
Web Workers have their own thread, stack, heap, and message queue. They run scripts in background threads. Two distinct runtimes can only communicate through sending messages via the `postMessage` message. These are considered too heavyweight for most client-side use cases.

## Asynchronous Functions and Await
While awaiting, you can do minor processing in the middle. The async function runs until it blocks and then returns a promise.

```js
async function doSomeStuff() { 
	let result1, result2, result3; 
	result1 = await promise1; 
	if (result1 = “blue”) result2 = await promise2 
	else result2 = await promise3 
} 
doSomeStuff(); // kick off the async function 
DoSomeOtherStuff();
```

Rejected results from promises can be handed as exception using a try-catch block. An async function **always** returns a promise.

## Promises vs Await
### Promise Example
```js
// trying out promises
"use strict";
function callmebackin(s,subject) {
    return new Promise ( (resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout( () => {
            resolve("Returned call subject:"+subject)
        }, s*1000)
    })
}
console.log("First I call you about a dog")
let p1 = callmebackin (5,"about a dog")
let p2 = callmebackin(3,"about another dog")
p1.then( (subject) => console.log("Got called back: "+subject))
p2.then( (subject) => console.log("you called me back:"+subject))
//////////////////////////////
>> First I call you about a dog
>> you called me back:Returned call subject:about another dog
>> Got called back: Returned call subject:about a dog
```

The function `callmebackin` has two arguments, `s` for a number of seconds and `subject`. It returns a new promise. There are `resolve` and a `reject` callbacks and an executor function which sets a timeout for `s` \* 1000 milliseconds. When the timeout expires it will call the resolve routine with the argument: "Returned call subject:"+`subject`. 

So the objective of the `callmebackin` function is: to return a promise which will resolve in `s` seconds and will resolve to the value : "Returned call subject:"+`subject`.

### Async.. Await Example
```js
// trying out promises
"use strict";
function callmebackin(s,subject) {
    return new Promise ( (resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout( () => {
            resolve("Returned call subject:"+subject)
        }, s*1000)
    })
}

// trying out Async Await
async function waitaround() {
    let topic1 = await callmebackin(5,"about a dog");
    console.log("Got called back:"+topic1)
    let topic2 = await callmebackin(3,"about another dog");
    console.log("you called me back:"+topic2)
}
waitaround()
console.log("Hoping to get some calls")
//////////////////////////////
>> Hoping to get some calls
>> Got called back:Returned call subject:about a dog
>> you called me back:Returned call subject:about another dog
```

We use the same `callmebackin` function as before, which returns a promise.
