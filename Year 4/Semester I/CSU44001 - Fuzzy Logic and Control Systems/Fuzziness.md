## Fuzzy Logic
**Data** is objective, given measurements.
**Information** is sorted, classified data.

**Fuzzy logic** is how specifically vague data can be classified. It is a system of logic for dealing with vague concepts.

## Family Resemblances
"Family resemblances" was term coined by Ludwig Wittgenstein to discuss how we describe

>“psychological expressions as names of inner states or private experiences. Such names are given content, …, by private ostensive definitions.” 

Examples of elements in a family:
- Games: What is common between cricket, tennis, boxing, card games, mind games
- Elements: Alkali metals, Halogens, Transition elements…..short-lived elements 
- Species: Fixed and evolving – animals crawling on land and entering water; 
- Numbers: Integers, Fractions, Rational Number, Complex, Transcendental; 
- Ideologies: Democracies, Monarchies, Totalitarian 

Each family member is slightly different in a subtle manner; the boundaries are not clear - there are grades of differences, **fuzziness**.

## Machine Intelligence
### Machine intelligence
1. Requires uncertain reasoning with linguistic expressions,
2. Demands uncertain reasoning with linguistic information under the guidance of logic,
3. Depends on automated reasoning with linguistic information based on logic.

### Key Areas
#### Knowledge Representation
- How to represent our knowledge of the world and its interconnections using data structures based on logic and graph theory - ontologies, rule bases, knowledge bases.
- Use (theory of) fuzzy sets to represent objects, events, and their relationships, and the imprecision in the representation and uncertainty of measurements.
#### Reasoning (Inference)
- (Small) chains of inference on the represented knowledge - algorithms with manual overrides.
- A form of first-order logic using declarative propositions, quantification, and predication and allowing for alternative inferences.
#### Knowledge Deployment
- The display of the results and an approximate version of the results of inference that will help an end user of AI system to diagnose, plan, control with intuitive interfaces.
#### Learning
- Procedures and data structures to "learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and infer from patterns in data".
